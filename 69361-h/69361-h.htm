  <h4 class="nobreak" id="THE_ISLAND">THE ISLAND</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>T</b></span> was a warm autumn that year—a luminous
exception upon which the last summer of the
century was borne somewhat oppressively to
the very verge of winter. The middle hours
of the afternoon could be intolerable enough in
a big, busy city well upon the confines of the
South. The rush and whirr of looms was
carried far upon the air, and even into the
quietest streets wandered the noisy echoes of
the boulevards.</p>

<p>Yet it was dull and flat for the solitary
stranger, without interest in factories, or provincial
entertainment in friendship. It was
doubly dull for a woman past youth and all
its personal excitements to be extracted from
fleeting curiosity and thrills of anticipation;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
denied by reason of sex the stale delights of
café lounges, and by reason of station the
healthier and livelier hospitalities of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</i> and
peasant reunions.</p>

<p>Travelling-bag and portmanteau lay strapped
in the hotel hall. The train for Paris would
not leave until late that night, and to while
away the intervening hours I went forth beyond
the town. I chose the farther end of the
long boulevard, the middle of which I had not
yet passed. Down there the brilliant air lost
its clearness in a yellow mist, as if flung from
the sky in a fine dust of powdered gold. Upon
its edge hung the last visible arms of the trees
on either side, lucidly, of unwonted greenness,
the green we note in painted French landscapes,
brightly touched with yellow. I felt that something
fresh, cool, and soft must lie behind that
golden veil. It led my imagination as a child
is led out of the real, by the illusive promises
of fairyland.</p>

<p>Here sound was deadened, and city movements
seemed to faint away upon the weariness
of the long hot day. I glanced back at the
town. Behind me stretched the dusty boulevard,
and sharpened above it, against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
tremulous pellucid blue of the heaven, the profile
of quaint church-spires and heavy masses
of buildings. Ahead, my way was blocked
by the wide grey river, black where the shadows
touched it, silver where the full light shone
upon it. A bridge of grey stone spanned it
from the end of the boulevard to the other side,
the unexplored:—a bridge so old, so worn, so
silent and empty, that it might appropriately
be the path to the city cemetery.</p>

<p>This bridge I crossed in all its glamour
of sad enchantment. One of its arches was
broken, and made a dangerous gap above the
broad, quiet waters. There were no lamps, no
visible indication of life about. I saw that it
led to an island encircled by a battered and
decayed dark wall, with little castellated ornaments
that gave it the look of a feudal fortress
of unusual extent and dimensions. Midway
I stood upon the bridge, and wondered what
sort of land might be before me. At first I
believed it to be uninhabited, until much gazing
discovered a thin curl of blue smoke far away,
beyond a square tower. It was nearing sunset
now, and the island lying west, showed out
more darkly from a broad band of reddish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
glory. It wore all the more dead and desolate
air because of the floating and quickened light
above it.</p>

<p>Have you ever, in some quaint French town
washed by a wide river, watched these lovely
sunset contrasts on the blackened greyness of
stone masses and on the sombre placidity of
water? The best effects you will find upon the
Loire, and if you can recall them, you will see,
better than words of mine can paint, the salient
features of that river-view set with towers and
a decayed, old grey wall.</p>

<p>I was saturated with the sadness of it, and
my glance was still wedded to its dead charm,
when a bloused peasant came out of the under
shadows and luminous red upper sphere, like
a cheerful commonplace note in the picturesque
mystery of the imagination. Very real he
looked, and not in the least like a ghost from
other centuries. Prosperous, too, as befits
a peasant who has earned his right to nod
to his betters, and mayhap clink free and
fraternal glasses with them through an ocean
of blood. He came along, whistling a patriotic
tune, with his hands in his pockets, and his
hat in villainous emphasis cocked over one ear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>‘Can it be,’ I asked myself, in a pang of
disappointment, ‘that this enchanted island
contains the ubiquitous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</i>, and that the
impossible legend of liberty, equality, and
fraternity has penetrated, with its attendant
train of horrid evils, into this home of silence
and poetic decay?’</p>

<p>I interrupted my gloomy moralising, for
which, like all persons naturally gay, I flatter
myself I have a decided turn, and hat, metaphorically,
in hand, sued this roadside rascal
for information.</p>

<p>‘Yes, people lived upon the island, not
many—mostly women: laundresses upon
the side that ran unprotected down to the
water edge. I might see their sheds if I
made the round of the wall. There was a
large Benedictine convent at one end, and a
cemetery eastward—but no hotel accommodation,
no shops, no vehicles of any sort,
and but one miserable little wine-shop,
where they sold the worst brandy in all
France.’</p>

<p>Of this liquid I concluded the fellow had
been drinking somewhat copiously, and left
him to push inquiries for myself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>I know not why, but the moment I set foot
upon the island, and heard the slow swish of
the eddying river against its projecting base,
thought was checked upon mild and pleasurable
suspense. Something unexpected must
surely happen, I believed, and step by step
destiny seemed to impel me forward in its
pursuit. My footfall rang sharply upon the
empty path, and I felt it would be ignominy
to leave this strange spot until fate had spoken,
and its voice been interpreted adequately for
me by circumstance.</p>

<p>How still everything was, and how softly
the day’s heat was stealing out of the atmosphere!
One bright star shone like a lamp
over a noble ruin, and for this I made. No
sound of living voice, no clang of wooden shoe
or beat of hoofs broke the heavy silence, and
by this fact I knew that I must still be remote
from the washerwomen’s quarter. There was
a fearful look about the low rocks that reached
behind the ruins down to the black water,
whose perilous stillness was unwholesomely
revealed by the margin of quivering light shed
from the rosy sky.</p>

<p>A few yards farther brought me to the open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
cemetery gate. Here I entered with a shuddering
sense of the romantic appropriateness
of its aspect. Did ever churchyard wear so
solemn, so forsaken an air of death? Death
was breathed in the profuseness and dankness
of the weeds that sprawled over and almost
enveloped the tombstones; in the grassy walks
unworn by tread of foot; in the graves that
showed no sacred care of hand, no symbol
of fond remembrance or bereaved heart. Who
were these dead so forgotten and so alone?
So near a busy city, and so remote from living
man?</p>

<p>Suddenly my wondering fancy was visibly
answered by sight of a slim old woman in
black, who slowly came toward me by a
narrow side-path. I stopped her with an
elaborate apology, and we speedily fell into
talk. She had been born on this island sixty
years before, when the century was entering
into middle life, and now at its close these
had been the permanent limits of her vision.
About a dozen times she may have crossed
the bridge, or walked the streets of the city
yonder, and only once had she gone down the
river in a barge to have a peep at the real
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
South—the ardent, rose and lavender-smelling
South!</p>

<p>‘I pray you, Madame, tell me, who am a
restless vagabond, never three months happy
in the same place, how life looks to one like
you, who have never left the boundary marks
of birth, who have grown and lived amid unchanged
scenes, and have been satisfied to look
for sixty years upon these low grey walls and
the spires and chimneys of that distant city?’
I asked, profoundly astonished.</p>

<p>In the old dame’s wrinkled parchment face
gleamed a pair of singularly vivid brown eyes
that held, I suspect, more wisdom than my
dissatisfied and travelled glance. She eyed me
curiously one long eloquent moment, and then
remarked, with some astuteness and much
benevolence, that change brought idle misery,
and monotony its own reward of ignorance and
content. Further questions about the island
led to an offer from her to show me where she
lived—an offer I accepted eagerly, and together
we left the cemetery, now revealing all
its melancholy charm in the last flushed smile
of a lovely autumn sunset.</p>

<p>Save for the glimmer of gold upon an upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
casement, the grey street was already cast into
twilit gloom, and a faint ray here and there
seemed to make its own pathway through the
dim troubled blue of the atmosphere. Unmistakably
evening was upon us, and the
ghosts of the imagination would surely soon be
abroad among these haunted scenes.</p>

<p>But nobody could be less spectral than my
companion, both in speech and in looks. She
was communicative to rashness, and when I
asked where I could obtain lodging upon the
island, for a week or a month, as long as the
caprice pleased me—she fixed me in a mild
interrogative way, and paused, as if equally in
doubt of my discretion and of her own.</p>

<p>There was no hotel, no lodgings that she
knew of, but if Madame really desired it—if,
in fact, she could trust Madame to be discreet
and reserved, she did not know that it might
not be managed somehow. But she would not
engage herself.</p>

<p>I pressed for an explanation, and so aflame
was I with sharp interest and curiosity, that I
know not what wild pledges of reserve and
discretion and prudent behaviour I proffered.
Willingly at that moment would I have undertaken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to deny my whole past, and give the lie
direct to nature. What more potent than passionate
sympathy? and the old woman, I think,
must have felt some desperate need for a willing
ear in which to pour her pent-up confidences.
The cup of silence to which experience had
condemned her was full to overflowing, and my
voice it seems shook the brim.</p>

<p>She told me then that she was the confidential
servant and sole companion of a
maiden lady who lived alone with a little niece
in a big barrack of a house below the Benedictine
monastery. There was a story, of course,
which perhaps one day I should hear, if matters
could be so arranged that I might sojourn
a while beneath their roof. But this also was
a promise withheld. Nothing depended on
her, though she had influence—naturally, she
added, with a look of meaning that set my
heart in a flutter. I declare it made me feel
young again, and full of thrilling alarm, on the
heels of romance, in the quest of breathless adventure.
I cannot explain how this old peasant
had the knack of accentuating commonplace
words, and of lending them a significance far
beyond that with which we are accustomed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
associate them. But she did so, and there was
a nameless charm and tremor conveyed in her
added ‘naturally,’ with its accompanying suppressed
intimation of glance.</p>

<p>The Benedictine monastery lay in massive
gloom below, reaching an aerial coldness of
sharp point and spire along its jagged tops.
Feudal gashes in the arches let in large slips of
green sky and glimmering stars, and its rough
stone wall along one side was the division
between the convent and the garden of my
companion’s mistress. No, not even the cemetery
I had left could, in the dreariest hour, look
more inexpressibly dark, and lifeless, and forsaken
than that old garden. Its beauty was
the beauty of death and sadness and neglect.
There were rotten arbours and stone seats, and
mossy, weed-grown paths. The underwood
was impenetrably thick, and only the fine old
trees lifted a calm front, indifferent to man’s
unkindness. They needed no human hand to
care them, and so they throve, and willingly
gave grateful shade, and the splendour of their
foliage, and the majesty of their form to the
dead scene. But of flowers there were none.
A coating of moss, bleached and faded, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
grown over the old sun-dial, which now was
hidden under the branching trees. Not a bird
sang, nor did any live thing skurry into hiding
upon sound of my footstep, as I wandered
through the dusky alleys, while my guide went
inside to consult her mistress.</p>

<p>The quiet of an empty garden, showing no
sign of care or an active presence about it,
while within view of smoke and fierce city
activities, is surely not comparable with any
other quiet in nature. Restriction adds to its
intensity. The silence becomes almost palpable
from the hum of existence afar, and the spirit
of the place seems more vividly personal by
reason of the narrowness of vision. You may
walk along the loneliest beach man ever trod,
and feel less alone than I did in that garden.
The dimness of the biggest forest would be
comforting after the intolerable motionlessness
of its leaves and plumy weeds.</p>

<p>I was beginning to wonder if it would be
possible for me to fulfil my contract should
the lady of the house consent to share her roof
with me, when I heard a child’s clear, joyous
laugh. It was a sound of heavenly music to
me just then, and effectually dispersed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
gruesome mist which was fast enveloping my
reason. The desolation of the place, and the
ghastly images which threatened nightmare,
could only be accidental, I wisely concluded,
if such laughter—fresh, untroubled, and sweet—might
be heard unrebuked. When the old
woman reappeared, alarm was already soothed,
and I was back in the grip of fascinating excitement.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle gives me permission to dispose
of the lower <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i>, which we never
occupy now,’ she said, with a smile so human
and inviting that I could have embraced her on
the spot.</p>

<p>We walked toward the house, which, though
gloomy enough, showed nothing to match the
mystery of the dark garden. Three broad discoloured
steps led to the hall of the lower
story, which was offered for my occupation, and
inside the large stone hall I noted a little carriage
and two wooden horses worked by springs.</p>

<p>‘The sound of Gabrielle’s carriage will not, I
hope, disturb Madame? She generally plays
here, as there is not space enough upstairs.’</p>

<p>I expressed myself delighted to be in close
neighbourhood with the child’s playground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>‘These used to be poor Madame’s rooms,’
she added, with a big sigh, as she opened the
door of a fine, chill salon.</p>

<p>‘The mother of Mademoiselle,’ I conjectured.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no; Mademoiselle’s mother always preferred
the rooms upstairs—those which Mademoiselle
now lives in. These were her sister’s—young
Madame, Gabrielle’s mother.’</p>

<p>‘She is dead?’</p>

<p>‘Alas! yes. It is unlucky to be too much
loved—unlucky for loved one and for lovers.
Dr. Vermont has never been here since his
wife’s death—has never even seen little Gabrielle
since she was born, and Mademoiselle has
never once smiled.’</p>

<p>I was content to reserve my curiosity for
another moment, and applied my attention
exclusively to the question of my installation.
My vanity, I will own, was something flattered
by its magnificence. There were two handsome
salons, a bed- and dressing-room, and a dining-room,
all richly furnished in Empire style. The
best taste may not have prevailed, but there could
be no question of substantial effectiveness, and
already an air of other days hung round it, and
made a pathetic appeal to the judgment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>As my companion showed me over the
kitchen and pantries and other domestic offices,
I noted on the farther side of the narrow
passage, beyond my bedroom, a closed door
which she did not offer to open. My sympathy
with Bluebeard’s wife was instantly
awakened, and that door became an object of
burning interest to me.</p>

<p>From the kitchen she conducted me through
the dining-room window into a long glass-roofed
gallery, jutting out beyond the house
and seeming to hang over the river, so completely
hidden were the rocks below. The
city lights along the opposite bank were
visible, and the heavy masses of boats and
barges made moving shadows through the dusk.</p>

<p>‘How lovely!’ I exclaimed, sniffing the soft
air delightedly. ‘Here will I sit and walk and
read and muse. A month, did I say! I could
cheerfully end my days here.’</p>

<p>‘We have no servant at your disposal,
Madame,’ the old woman said, phlegmatically
checking my enthusiasm by a reminder of the
trials of existence. ‘But until you have procured
one, I shall be glad to give you any
assistance in my power.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>I thanked her heartily, and inquired if I could
find a fiacre to drive at once for my luggage to
town. There was no such thing on the island,
she calmly informed me. Nothing in the shape
of a wheeled object ever crossed the bridge
from the city except the morning vans and the
weekly butcher’s cart. Once a week the laundresses
wheeled their barrows of linen into
town and returned on the same day with the
supply for the week’s washing. She could
recommend a little maid, whose mother would,
no doubt, be glad to undertake to market for
me for a consideration, and her I could engage
on my way to the hotel.</p>

<p>I left the amiable old dame to prepare for
my reception that night, and set forth in the
dropping twilight in search of the maid and my
portmanteau. I had the wisdom, however, to
dine at the hotel before returning to the
gloomy island.

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>T</b></span> was late when I drove across the bridge
from the town. The noise of rumbling wheels
upon the pavement, as the cab clattered past
the arches, was of such unearthly volume as to
arouse the soundest sleeper. In one or two
casements lights and alarmed faces showed;
but for the rest, the islanders turned upon their
pillows, scarcely vexed by idle speculation upon
the disturbance.</p>

<p>The darkness of the house chilled my heart,
as the cab drove up the grassy pathway, and
when the door opened, and the old dame stood
in the hall in the uncertain illumination of a
single candle, the solitude of the place looked
so insufferably strange, that I rubbed my eyes
to ascertain if I were really awake and not
dreaming. But a substantial cabman was
waiting for his fare, and the woman’s thin
yellow hand was holding mine in a cordial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
clasp. I believe the honest creature had
already begun to miss me, and had been counting
the minutes until my reappearance.</p>

<p>She led me into the dining-room, where a
supper of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</i>, fruit, and burgundy was prepared
for me, and though I protested that I was not
hungry, she compelled me to make a pretence
of eating, for the excuse of lingering to talk to
me. Mademoiselle had long since retired. She
herself had slept a little in order to be fresh for
the excitement of my return.</p>

<p>We sat till far into the night, chatting about
the great world, about Paris, which to her
meant all the sin and misery and gaiety of the
entire universe; and about the big town of
Beaufort across the river. This impelled me to
stand up and draw the curtain, that I might
have a peep at it from the gallery. The old
woman followed me, and stood leaning beside
me against the flat stone balustrade. The
lights now along the water were few and
widely spread—but in the heaven they had
multiplied and twinkled, variously-hued, upon
their dark ground.</p>

<p>‘Down there lies the road to Beaufort—the
road to Paris,’ my companion murmured wistfully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
‘It is now ten years since Mademoiselle
has been watching it, but never a soul comes by
it—never a soul.’</p>

<p>‘Whom is she watching for?’ I asked, in a
tone insensibly lowered by her whisper.</p>

<p>‘For Dr. Vermont—little Gabrielle’s father.’</p>

<p>‘Is he the only relative she has?’</p>

<p>‘The only one. It is a sad story. The poor
lady is eating her heart out with sorrow for the
dead, and idle sorrowing for the living. The
dead at least loved her—but the living! Ah,
there is nothing harder in nature than the heart
of a man turned from a loving woman.’</p>

<p>‘Does Dr. Vermont know that Mademoiselle
loves him?’</p>

<p>‘Know!’ she cried indignantly. ‘Mademoiselle
is a proud woman. <i>I</i> know because I
divine it. He too might divine it, if feeling
could touch him. But he was always a hard
man. He stays away, and he does not write.
He cares no more for his child than he does for
Mademoiselle.’</p>

<p>She dropped into silence, and I did not want
to scare her by appearing in any way to force
her confidence. I was poignantly wakeful from
interest and the atmosphere of mystery I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
breathed; nevertheless, I yielded at once to
suggestion that the hours were lengthening towards
morning, and was glad enough to find
myself shuddering among the cold sheets that
had lain long in lavender presses, while I
listened to the echo of the old woman’s footsteps
upon the stairs and the sound of key in
lock and bolt drawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" >

<p>I was sleeping soundly when Joséphine
brought me my morning chocolate and drew
up the blind. She informed me that Mademoiselle
hoped I had slept well, and would do
me the honour of calling on me in the afternoon.
This courtesy both astonished and gratified me.
I had understood that Joséphine had half
smuggled me into the house, and that her
mistress had only given a grudging consent to
my admittance.</p>

<p>The morning I devoted to examination of
my quarters. I found the door of the mysterious
chamber locked, but as the key was on the
outside, I had the indiscretion to turn it and
look in. It was a luxurious bedroom, and
was as blue as one of Lesueur’s paintings.
Young Madame Vermont must indeed have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
adored the colour to suffer it in such monotonous
excess. The bed, of black polished wood, was
hung with blue silk curtains; the carpet was
of blue cloth, and blue prevailed in the handsome
rugs that relieved it. The couches, the
chairs, were covered with blue silk, and blue
muslin even draped the long looking-glass.
The bed looked ready for use; the blue embroidered
coverlet was turned down, and across
the lace-edged sheet was flung an unrolled
night-dress, as if somebody were momently
expected to lift it. On the dressing-table
several dainty objects of feminine toilette lay
ready to hand—even a little crushed lace handkerchief
was thrown hastily against a silver
hand-mirror. Beside the bed was a pair of
black velvet slippers, and across a chair a
frilled and expensive wrapper. Even the water
in the carafe on the table was fresh, and there
were matches beside the silver-wrought candle-stick.
A beautiful jar on an inlaid table in the
window recess contained hot-house flowers that
were only beginning to fade, but their untainted
perfume told of water daily renewed.</p>

<p>It was easy to divine the secret story of that
woman’s chamber. Mademoiselle cherished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the delusion, as unsubstantial food for her
hungry heart, that its occupant was merely
absent, and might be expected any day—any
hour. She refused to accept the irrevocableness
of death, and kept the chamber ready for
the wandering spirit when the ties of earth
should recall it. This was the meaning of the
turned-down bed and unfolded night-dress; of
the flowers in the jar sent from the city and
carefully watered each evening; of the little
handkerchief eloquently wisped against the
silver mirror. I retreated softly, and closed
the door as if of some sacred place.</p>

<p>After an interview with the maid who came
to wait upon me, I lounged in the gallery until
the midday breakfast. The aspects and surroundings
enchanted me still more by day than
they had done the night before. I felt alone—solemnly
alone between large spaces of sky and
water. Underneath, the river flowed broadly,
and upon its bosom the big barges travelled
southward, and lighter vessels glided swiftly
by to drop behind the bridge, whence the eye
could follow their path no more. Below the
broken arches and towered points of the bridge
went the road to Beaufort and the wide world,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
a white dust-blown band along the grey
horizon. Under a blazing sun showed the
outlines of the city, and the strained ear might
detect the far-off murmur of looms by help of
the factory chimneys. But this needed an
effort of imagination in so heavy and dense a
silence.</p>

<p>After breakfast I bethought myself of a visit
to the melancholy garden by way of change.
On the stairs I caught the pleasant patter of
small feet and the shrill, sweet notes of a child’s
voice. I stepped into the hall, where Gabrielle
was at play. She was not pretty, but so lively
and spirited and quaint, that she gave a fuller
notion of the charm of childhood than any
pretty child I have known. She knew neither
shyness nor fear. When she saw me, she
stopped her play, and approached me boldly.</p>

<p>‘You are the strange lady Joséphine says I
am not to bore,’ she said gravely, without any
resentment or surprise that she should be asked
to consider me.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will bore me a good deal, little
one,’ I replied. ‘I love children, and am delighted
when they take notice of me and
chatter to me.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>‘I like chattering, too, but my aunt is very
silent. She is always learning lessons and
reading books. Do you learn lessons still?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes, when I am not too lazy. But I
am like you, I don’t like lessons and work,—I
prefer play.’</p>

<p>‘If you like, I will play with you,’ she offered,
with a serious condescension that was captivating.
‘I have no one to play with except
Minette and Monsieur Con. Wouldn’t you
like to see Minette? She is a little fluffy,
white kitten. Monsieur Con is my rabbit.
Come and I will show them to you.’</p>

<p>This was the start of a friendship delightful
enough to have moored my barque to those
island shores for an indefinite period, if even
there had been no irresistible interest of environment
and personality to enthral me. But
Mademoiselle Lenormant’s character was a
character of unusual fascination—not in the
sense of sexual attraction but from the point
of view of study. She came and sat with me
for half an hour late that afternoon. I could
not fitly describe her as formal, for she breathed
of austere sadness and study. Her pretensions
to beauty, in the accepted form, can never have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
been great, but defective features found an
abundant apology in the extreme delicacy of
the pallid face and a certain wistful eagerness
and suppressed tenderness of expression. It
was a face to haunt you into the silent watches
of the night, in its mute eloquence of suggestion—like
a spirit or a picture. Having looked once
upon it, it dwelt for ever apart in the memory,
constantly provoking thought, conjecture, and
raking the fanciful waters of romance by
gliding dreams of sorrow and solitude, and
the tragedy that finds no voice or fraternal
sympathy upon the noisy surface of life.</p>

<p>Silence I should say had been the great
feature of her existence. Even upon the odd
impersonal subjects that sprang up for discussion
in our conversations, her talk was scant
and weighted with an unusual intonation, as if
speech came to her amiss. She pondered each
commonplace I uttered, and gazed steadfastly
into space or down upon the river before replying,
which she did very seriously after a long pause.
At first this eccentricity of hers much disconcerted
me. To exclaim in soft rapture, ‘How
lovely the stillness here is!’ and a few minutes
later, when you had quite lost sight of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
trite observation, to have it cast back upon
the wavering plain of dialogue in some such
manner, and in tones of musing gravity:</p>

<p>‘You think such stillness as this lovely? It
is perhaps the novelty of it alone that enchants
you’—</p>

<p>Or, in response to a previous half-forgotten
remark received in absolute silence, that the
way the boats and barges dropped suddenly
out of view as they passed under the bridge
was strangely attractive, to find the idea caught
by the heels, and gently forced into earnest
discussion by a word of imperious invitation.
For there was an air of extremely winning
command about her, that from the first I found
impossible to resist. Her neck was long, and
the head upon it beautifully set, and her movements,
her gestures and looks, were those of
a princess in disguise. An over-wrought
imagination might of course—possibly did—exaggerate
this air of command and these
sovereign attitudes, but I came afterwards to
see that I was not alone in my delusion, and
that upon ardent youth of the other sex, her
quiescent influence could be potential to salvation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Of the nature of her occupations and ideas I
remained quite in the dark for some days to
come. Regularly, of an afternoon, she would
visit me in the gallery, where we sat and discussed
the ‘eternal verities’ in an abrupt,
unenthusiastic way. I could see that she purposely
withheld herself, her real self, from
intrusion or impertinent survey. Seclusion
had taught her prudence, and reticence was a
natural gift. But how in the name of the
marvellous, upon an empty island, where social
intercourse is undreamed of, had she come by
knowledge of the hollowness of casual expansion
and the nothingness of ready sympathy?</p>

<p>This is a lesson the cynical society deity
teaches us after harsh and prolonged experiences
of considerable variety, and except to its
votaries, could only be known to those hermits
who went into the desert to rest from the vanity
of experiment and pleasure.</p>

<p>Joséphine’s garrulity, however, made instructive
Mademoiselle’s reserve. From her I
learnt, by meagre instalments, this enigmatic
lady’s story. But not much until a little scene
had pushed me upon the other side of discretion,
and driven me to sue for enlightenment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>It happened thus. In the grip of wakefulness
I had gone out to walk about the gallery.
There was no moon, and upon the turn of the
season, the night was chill and starless. Across
the smoke-coloured heaven odd masses wandered,
pursued by the wind that blew down
from the North. The river below made a stain
of exceeding blackness in the dark picture, and
beat the rocks in angry protest against the
whining uneasiness of the air. For it whined
dismally round the island, and blew among the
trees of the garden like an army of dreary
banshees. A sense of horror of the place grew
upon me, and I began to hunger for the big
bright world beyond; for gas-lit streets and
the sordid aspects of city life. I yearned to
jostle my fellows along the highways once
more, and listen to the sound of vocal dispute
upon the public place. I saw in vision streams
of people emerging from illuminated theatres,
heard the cheerful roll of carriages, and the
noisy murmur of laughter and speech. I
longed for it all again—all that I had despised,
and told myself in the midst of its enjoyment
that I hated. After all, I was but a poor
mountebank of a hermit. Town born, I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
never hope to free myself permanently from the
influences of birth, and I knew that sooner or
later nostalgia for city sounds and sights—for
the multitudinous accompaniments of its existence,
must find me and pursue me into the
heart of the most congenial solitude, into the
most heavenly of rural retreats.</p>

<p>The gallery ran round the angles of the house,
and on the other side looked down into the
garden and in upon the window of Madame
Vermont’s blue room. I went round it in a
thirst for movement, but, fearful of disturbing
the sleep of others, I walked very softly. To
my complete surprise, and I will not aver without
a momentary qualm of terror, I saw the
reflection of a stream of light upon the near
window of the blue chamber. I hardly believe
in ghosts; but it would indeed be rash to hint
that it was no vague dread of the supernatural
that started my unequal heart-beats just then.
I felt the blood gush and swell to bursting the
arteries about my temples and throat, and at
the back of my ears. Fright was not a check
upon curiosity, but rather a strong impetus.
Though I might approach in a conflict of
emotions, I did not hesitate for one moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to approach, and was confronted with sharp
disappointment when I saw that the stream of
light upon the floor fell from an earthly candle-stick,
and that Mademoiselle was leaning over
the polished foot of the bed and gazing steadfastly
at the empty pillow.</p>

<p>It did not take me an instant to recover my
balance and watch the scene with revived interest.
This was my second glimpse of the blue
chamber, and a poignant note was now added
to its fascination. There was a more speaking
look about the turned-down sheet, the unrolled
night-dress across it, and the hastily flung
wrapper. Not of death—but of an unwonted
disparition and a watched-for return it spoke.
Not of anguish and bereavement was it eloquent,
but of the fruitless and undying hunger of expectation.
At such an hour, so sanctified by
pervading sorrow and silence, the blue of the
room was no longer garish, but an appropriate
setting for imprisoned regret. Its very uniformity
and depth of colour suggested the
solemnity, the profundity of a rich sky unstained
by cloud, and, enveloped in this mystic hue,
Mademoiselle seemed to be the spirit of sorrow
resting upon the grave of all joy—mute, placidly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
unhopeful, visibly unafraid. For surely such
solitude as hers was calculated to bend the
proudest head and break the strongest heart,
and in presence of her indomitable courage I
felt abashed and mean by confrontation with
my recent idle terror.</p>

<p>I knew well that it was my duty to turn
away my eyes and leave so sacred a vigil unwatched,
but when duty and curiosity, strongly
roused, come into mortal conflict, it is not often
that the former conquers. I waited to see how
long Mademoiselle would linger in that room,
what her movements might be, and how she
would depart for the upper house. And as I
waited, I saw her come round by the side of
the bed with a quick, sudden step, and gently
smooth the pillow. In doing so, her hand
rested heavily in the middle, and made a distinct
impression. She started back, and I could
see that desperate emotion stiffened her thin
white face, and the large grey eyes she lifted,
in the full light of the candle upon the table
beside her, were full of pain. By a gesture so
slight, it appeared she had startled memory
into wakeful protest, and now she hastened to
quiet it, and trod feverishly upon the living
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
embers to still their fires by giving to the bed
its proper aspect of emptiness. She turned the
pillow, gathered up the ruffled sheet, crushed
the night-dress into careless folds, and thrust
it beneath the blue coverlet. As white was
hidden under the blue, resignation seemed to
have banished expectation angrily, and brought
the curtain down ruthlessly upon the poor
pathetic comedy weakness played for its own
diversion.</p>

<p>She took the candle up, stood near the door,
and gazed slowly around her. The little handkerchief
wisped against the silver mirror caught
her eye. She jerked forward and grasped it
eagerly; so flimsy was it that it almost melted
in her slight palm. I remembered there was a
faint, subtle odour of violets about the room,
which seemed to emanate from that handkerchief.
I can imagine how it must have risen
and tyrannised her senses, can measure the
strength of its appeal and its delicate charm.
No women are so astute and penetrative in
their use of scent as Frenchwomen. It is their
study to spread their essence with refined
cruelty, and leave an imperishably perfumed
trace to check the wandering imagination,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and keep tenanted by a personal odour the
sanctuaries of the heart they have forsaken.</p>

<p>The effect of the faded sweetness of the
handkerchief was to irritate her to what I concluded
to be a resolution to have done with this
miserable comedy of expectation. She held it
from her fiercely, and threw back her head to
get further away from its insidious appeal, and
then approached it to the flame of the candle.
It needed but a flutter of light against it, and
the flimsy thing was a brief yellow flare. She
watched until the flame had burnt itself out,
and then threw the charred rag upon the marble
top of the night-table, and swayed unsteadily
towards the door. By the way she grasped
her throat with one frail, nervous hand, I could
divine how the thick sobs shook her, and I
wondered more and more upon the mystery
of her life, and what elements combined to form
the mimic tragedy of that midnight solitude.</p>

<p>Outside the breath of winter was upon us,
and the wind bit and stung with the sharpness
of ice. It was December now, and vigils upon
the terrace, once the sun was gone down and
the stars were out, were a forbidden pleasure
in careful middle-age.

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span> month of December ran itself out with a
more ruffled mildness than November had done.
For one thing, it was cold, blustering weather,
and for days together ice sheeted the broad
river. The boats and barges plied less frequently,
and foot-passengers now rarely threaded
the long boulevard from the city to the island
bridge. Only the morning vans relieved us
of a complete sense of separation from our
fellows, and at odd intervals, the postman came,
and carried a whiff of the outer world into our
retreat. On Saturday we had the excitement
of watching the laundresses wheel their barrows
of linen across the bridge, and diminish with the
distance upon the chill, bleak road, sometimes
brightened by rays of winter sunshine. But for
the rest we shared such desert stillness as might
be found in the heart of an empty forest, instead
of upon the edge of a busy and populous town.</p>

<p>Within the walls, life went pleasantly enough.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
My presence downstairs had served to tame
Mademoiselle somewhat. She stood less impenetrably
apart, and her discourse grew daily
less impersonal. When walks upon the terrace
and musing under the roof of the gallery meant
perilous exposure, she would invite me upstairs
to her own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i>. This I enjoyed. It
gave me a sense of fraternity in silence as well
as companionable speech at discretion.</p>

<p>Her rooms were less spacious than those I
occupied, but more comfortable, and not without
a surprising effort at cosiness. In her salon
a wood fire burned brightly, and the deep worn
arm-chairs had an inviting aspect. Everything
was faded, often frayed and rent, but the
pictures were old and of some value, and books
bulged out beyond their natural shelves, and
overflowed upon the floor, and crowded the
tables. Books, books everywhere,—old books,
tattered books, dog-eared, dusty, and moth-eaten;
wearing all a heavy, learned look, and suggestive
of historical research. I laughingly remarked
this to her one day, as I removed a big tome
from the low chair I wished to sit upon. She
blushed that soft pink flush belonging to faces
habitually pallid. It made her look delightfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
young and interesting, and conveyed the hope
to me that the last barrier of her glacial reserve
was about to break down.</p>

<p>‘I have been for many years engaged upon
research among these volumes,’ she admitted
slowly, after a pause; ‘I am writing an important
book.’</p>

<p>‘An important book?’ I cried interrogatively.</p>

<p>‘Yes: the life of the Emperor Julian. I regard
him as the great Misunderstood of the Christian
world, and I wish to rehabilitate him,’ she said;
and there was such a touching and simple prayer
for sympathy and encouragement in the glance
she fixed on mine, that I had not the heart to
remember that others had attempted the same
task, and that no amount of learned eloquence
and indignation would teach the Christian world
to regard as desirable a better understanding of
him they call the great Apostate.</p>

<p>‘Would it be an indiscretion to solicit information
upon your plan of defence?’ I asked
insidiously, with intent to force her into self-exposure.
To me the character of the Emperor
Julian was of comparative insignificance beside
her own, but this fact I naturally kept to myself.</p>

<p>‘I shall bring him into noble relief by means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
of Frederick the Great as a background—Frederick,
that other famous and less reputable
disciple of Marcus Aurelius. Have you ever
remarked how alike and how unlike they were—one
so sincere and the other so cynically
insincere?’</p>

<p>Upon a dead island, without new books, or
newspapers, or theatres, and but little out-door
life, because of the ferocity of the weather, the
Emperor Julian and Frederick the Great were
as good subjects of discussion as any others, and
I entered the lists in combative mood, fully
equipped in argument and opinion, and captivated
by the grim earnestness and complete
guilelessness of the Imperial Pagan’s defender.
Of modern literature she was, perhaps not
unwisely, ignorant, and knew not of a man
named Ibsen who, some years earlier, had also
strayed upon this ground. She had been chiefly
inspired by an abominable novel of a French
Jesuit, over which she waxed exceedingly hot.
Her anger was splendid, and I should have
rejoiced to see the Jesuit, Julian’s traducer,
confronted with this thin spiritual-looking lady,
who thrilled from head to foot with generous
hatred of all meanness and unfairness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>‘As a Christian, my defence will have more
weight than if I were imbued with the cold
agnosticism of the day,’ she added naïvely.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ I assented, full of admiration, and
more pleased to think of her as a Catholic
eager to make atonement to an ancient enemy
of her faith, than ‘the cold agnostic’ she dismissed
in a tone of implied disapproval.</p>

<p>‘You wonder, perhaps, at the serious nature
of my studies and labour,’ she observed. And
then, upon a little explanatory nod and arch
of delicate brow, ‘You see my father was a
scholar, and as we lived here quite alone and
rarely received visitors, it was impossible for
him to avoid taking me into his confidence.
And then, when his health began to fail him,
it naturally devolved upon me to help him,
as far as I could, and spare his eyes.’</p>

<p>Her glance travelled wistfully round the
room, and a ray of mild recognition fell upon
each big volume. It was not difficult to understand
how vividly of the past they spoke to her,
how eloquent of association was their wild disorder.
In the high embrasure of the back
window, which looked down upon the river, and
showed a glimpse of the chimney-tops and tall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
spires of Beaufort, there was a dainty, blue-lined
work-table, and near it a revolving book-stand
and a rocking-chair. From where I sat,
I could note that the books were modern—some
of them were bound coquettishly, but the
greater number were paper-covered. I was not
wrong in supposing this to have been the
favourite recess of the late Madame Vermont.
The blue satin of the work-table betrayed her,
and a hurried inspection of the backs of the
books convinced me that her taste in literature
was all that is most correct and elegant. No
ancient tomes these. No bramble-strewn paths
to historic research. Nothing whatever about
the Emperor Julian; still less about Marcus
Aurelius. Bourget, Feuillet, Gyp, Loti, Marcel
Prévost, Anatole France and company: these
were the friends of pretty Madame Vermont’s
solitude, the entertainers of her frugal leisure.
From the start, without description, word, or
hint, I had understood Madame Vermont to
be uncommonly pretty. I pictured her small,
blonde, charmingly coquettish, and self-conscious.
I endowed her with every conventional
fascination, and felt sure that if I had been a
man I should have adored her, like the rest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
As a matter of fact, my imagined picture of her
came very near reality. Only instead of fair
hair, she had the loveliest brown that made a
flossy network round a little rosebud of a face;
her eyes were bewitchingly blue, limpid like a
child’s, and her cheek was adorably hued. Just
the conventional angelic being to turn male
heads, and set their hearts in a flutter; just the
sort of home idol to keep nurses and sisters—especially
elder, grave, and sensible sisters—perpetually
on their knees, and the domestic
incensor perpetually filled with the freshest of
perfumed flattery swung by the most abject
adorers.</p>

<p>Now that the icy winds prevented us from
sitting out in my gallery, Mademoiselle had
grown accustomed to receive me upstairs. For
there was no conquering her repugnance to my
rooms. She found it less hard to walk with
Joséphine to the cemetery than to sit and talk
of other matters with a stranger in her dead
sister’s house. Of me, however, she had grown
fond:—at first in a furtive way, as if not quite
sure that she was right in yielding to the weakness.
Gradually she emerged from this quaint
and insular uncertainty; saw that there was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
shame attached to the discovery that a new
face could delight her, and graciously abandoned
herself to the influence of a full-blown
affection.</p>

<p>Every morning Joséphine came down with
Mademoiselle’s compliments, and her desire to
be informed if I had slept well. Every afternoon
I mounted to drink a cup of English tea
with her, and listen to her last pages on the
great Misunderstood, and sometimes maliciously
spur her into passion by some sceptical raillery,
which always brought pained reproach to her
sad eyes and a slight flush to her pale face.
She took everything in earnest, even my feeble
jokes, which after a while, when she began to
understand them, she would proceed to discuss
in her own quaint, slow way.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it must be a matter of temperament,
or perhaps it is an Irish peculiarity,’ she
would say, and inspect me very seriously.</p>

<p>I assured her that the Irishman was not
born who could not change his opinion at a
moment’s notice for the fun of the thing, and
in the midst of comedy fall foul upon tragedy
for pure diversion’s sake. She shook her
head despondently, and decided at once that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
there could be found no earnest scholars, no
born leaders of men, in a band of amiable
buffoons.</p>

<p>My moments of recreation and distraction
were enjoyed with Gabrielle, when we walked
round the desert island in search of adventures,
or with elaborate care, tried to make each other
understand the caprices of our wandering fancies
in the alleys of the sad, mysterious garden.
It was pure joy to feel the little hand clinging
to my arm or lost in my palm like a soft, small
bird, and hear the pretty patter of running steps
alongside of my brisk strides. For, to atone
for its late appearance, the winter was mortally
cold, and there was no dallying with frozen
toes and frost-bitten ears. But to make up for
this foolish superiority of mine in the matter of
steps, Gabrielle was indulgence itself to my
decided inferiority upon imaginative ground.
I certainly could not imagine so many things
out of nothing, and it was clear that I could
not make up so many charming adventures for
Minette and Monsieur Con. But in my gross
grown-up way, I was not an unsympathetic
confidante for the grievances and perplexities of
solitary childhood. Indeed, Gabrielle admitted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
with off-hand majesty of look and deportment,
that I was rather a nice and entertaining
person for a little girl to talk to, not above the
simple pleasures of play, and not beneath the
romantic joys of story-telling. Now she loved
her aunt; oh, yes, she certainly loved her aunt
above and beyond all the world. But her aunt,
you see, was so very solemn, and then she read
so many books, she was quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entichée</i> of those
big, hard-looking books. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entichée</i>, she admitted,
in answer to my amused and not altogether
edified surprise, was an expression she had
caught from my servant Marie. It was Marie,
she repeated imperiously, who said her aunt
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entichée</i> of books, and she was pleased
to find it a very good word. She was the
quaintest and drollest little philosopher and
playmate melancholy middle-age could desire,
and I am not without shrewd suspicion that I
learnt more from her than she from me.</p>

<p>Of an evening, as I sat alone downstairs over
my coffee, and snoozed comfortably over one of
Mademoiselle’s books, or puffed a meditative
cigarette in front of the bright wood fire, Joséphine
would come down for a chat on her own
account. It amused me to draw her out upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the subject of Mademoiselle, and bit by bit I
pieced her story together.</p>

<hr class="tb" >

<p>Monsieur Lenormant, the father of two girls,
had had a serious political difference with his
family, who were all staunch Bonapartists, while
he stood by the republic, and flung his hat
into the air whenever they played the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>.
With no desire to parade this difference,
and being a shy and sensitive man, despite his
republican sympathies, he chose evasion by
the road of retreat. He left Beaufort, where
his family were an influence, and bought the
old house on the island. Here few were likely
to disturb him, and political temptation could
not be expected to pursue him.</p>

<p>His ostensible excuse was the possession of
scholarly tastes and indifference to the present.
The death of his wife upon the birth of a second
girl, Adèle, was seemingly a further inducement
to seek the soothing shade of solitude.
So the widower, accompanied by his wife’s
confidential servant, Joséphine, and an old
gardener, Marcel, drove out of Beaufort, with
his children, his books, and his cats. In a little
while he was settled and hard at work among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the ancients, and the current world of republicans
and Bonapartists alike forgot him.</p>

<p>There was a difference of five years between
the children, and soon, too soon, little Henriette
was established upon the semi-maternal, wholly
self-sacrificing pedestal of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande sœur</i>. All
she had known of spontaneous childhood
was before her mother’s death. Henceforth
she was ‘mother’ herself, with Adèle for an
adored and adorable small tyrant. While still
in short frocks, her father, too, had got to rely
on her, and cling to her as to a grown-up
woman. He would gravely debate with her
upon matters it was but humane to suppose
she could understand nothing of. This may be
an excellent school for training in abnegation
and patient endurance, but it is a hard one.
Henriette slipped into maturity without any of
the sunshine of childhood across her backward
path. She was an uncomplaining, studious
little girl, and it is not surprising that Monsieur
Lenormant should have gone to the grave
without the remotest suspicion of the wrong he
had done her. Did she not love her father
devotedly? Did she not worship the pretty
Adèle? And what more can any sane and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
reasonable young woman demand of life than
ample opportunities for the practice of self-abnegation
and the worshipping of others?</p>

<p>When Henriette was a slip of a girl and
Adèle a child of ten, young Dr. Vermont, the
only son of Monsieur Lenormant’s comrade of
youth, came down to Beaufort from Paris, in
the full blaze of university honours, and not
without promise of future scientific renown,
backed by a substantial income and solid provincial
influence. This young man looked
surprisingly well upon horseback, and found it
good exercise to ride frequently from the town
to the house of his father’s old friend upon the
island. Arrived there, it amused him to notice
Adèle, who was free of anything like bashfulness,
and in return, thought him the nicest
person she had ever seen. Meanwhile, a grave,
tall girl, too thin for her ungraceful age,
looked on with very different eyes. To her
Dr. Vermont was the traditional Phœbus
Apollo of girlhood. She knew nothing of
romance, or novels, or poetry, but she felt the
dawn of womanhood upon sight of him, and
blushed in divine self-consciousness. She was
a plain girl then—unfinished, unformed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
painfully reserved; and it was not to be expected
that such an elegant article of semi-Parisian
make, as Dr. Vermont, should have an
eye for material so crude and undeveloped.
Had Dr. Vermont been thirty instead of twenty,
he might have thought differently, but we all
know how grandly exacting and dramatic
twenty is. Whereas his conquest was not in
the least astonishing. He was a fine-looking
lad, with plenty of pluck and grace and worldly
wisdom. He carried himself with a noble self-consciousness,
was sufficiently attentive to his
moustache to convince mankind of its supreme
importance, and already his handsome dark
eyes wore that look of mild scrutiny that never
left them. Altogether a youth with justifiable
pretensions and fascinations of an intellectual
and bodily nature, and one by no means likely
to learn to abate them by experience.</p>

<p>As the years went by, and the little women
of the dark house by the river grew with them,
the wealth of Monsieur Lenormant declined,
and when Dr. Vermont, now a distinctive <i>somebody</i>
in his profession, came down one summer,
and rode out from Beaufort to see him, matters
were so bad that he found it his duty to come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
every day during the rest of his vacation. Adèle
was now sixteen, a lovely flower opening in the
sun of romantic dreams. Can we wonder if
Dr. Vermont’s glance rested on her in amazed
admiration? Dr. Vermont said nothing, but
he looked. He looked constantly, and his
glances were not without eloquence for the
maiden blushing vividly beneath them. All
this Henriette saw, and loved her sister none
the less, wished not the less heartily both her
dear ones happiness and success, though her
own misery came of it. Only Monsieur Lenormant
understood nothing of the situation. His
dream always had been to marry his favourite
Henriette to his young friend Vermont, but death
overtook him before he could accomplish it.</p>

<p>One evening, as Dr. Vermont sat beside him
with his hand upon his pulse, the poor gentleman
looked up at him anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I have written for a relative, a lady, to come
and look after my girls, but you, François, I
expect to be their real protector. I like to
think of you as my daughter’s husband. She is
a good girl, François, an excellent girl. She
has been a devoted daughter, and an adoring
sister. She will make the best of wives.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>‘I am sure of it,’ said Dr. Vermont musingly,
as he glanced down to where the two girls were
silently embroidering in the deep recess of a
window above the river. He knew perfectly
well which daughter he was expected to marry
and which he intended to marry, but he kept
his counsel, and gazed in soft approbation upon
the charming profile of Adèle.</p>

<p>When he came next day, Monsieur Lenormant
had departed from this world of marriage
and giving in marriage, and the lady relative
had arrived. A formal engagement with Adèle
was speedily entered upon, and the Doctor
took the train for Paris, a happy prospective
bridegroom, with the advantage of being
in no hurry to jump into domestic responsibilities.
His betrothed was somewhat young,
and meanwhile he would have leisure to pursue
pleasure elsewhere, and nourish her placid love
upon the most expensive boxes of sweets direct
from Boissier, and instalments of light and
elegant literature to teach her what to respect
of life and from mankind.</p>

<p>The bride was eighteen and the groom
twenty-eight, when they were married one
spring morning in the Mairie and in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Cathedral of Beaufort. That marriage still
brought tears to Joséphine’s old eyes, and
tempted her to unhabitual eloquence. How
lovely the bride had looked!—too lovely, too
delicate for health and long life. Eyes limpid
like an angel’s, so sweetly blue and soft, a face
upon which the tenderest breath would bring
a stain of deepened colour, form slim and
curved and dainty in every detail. The groom
was proud, radiantly proud, perhaps not tender
enough and unapprehensive of the rough winds
of life for a creature so fragile and for bloom
so evanescent. But he looked distinguished,
well-bred, and eminently Parisian; and what
more could provincial spectators desire?</p>

<p>A more interesting figure far was the grave,
sad young lady, who smiled upon her happy
sister through her tears, and could find words
above the pain of a breaking heart to remind
the groom that Adèle had always been petted
and spoiled and cared, and fervently implore
him to do the same by her, and treat her more
like a child than a wife. The scene was clear
before me. Mademoiselle, as she must have
been at twenty-three, not pretty, but captivating
enough for eyes not blinded by mere animal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
beauty, as the Doctor’s were. And he, fatuous,
sure of himself, at heart indifferent to others,
and intoxicated with foolish marital satisfaction.
Did he know that tragedy brushed his happiness
that moment—softly, benignantly, with
blessing instead of prayer, with gaze of hope
instead of reproach?</p>

<p>Joséphine could tell me nothing, and it
pleased me to believe that he understood, and
some day might remember.</p>

<p>After some months in Paris, the little bride
was brought back to the dark house by the
river by an anxious husband, there to linger in
the warmth of two loves, two devotions, waited
upon, worshipped in vain. The opening of her
baby’s eyes was the signal for the closing of
her own. Not then, not then could Dr. Vermont
be expected to understand. As far as I
could gather from Joséphine’s account, he passionately
loved his young wife. Her death
crushed him for a while, and he walked the
earth like one blind to the changes of seasons,
blind to surrounding faces, and fronting a future
that would remain for ever a blank. Mademoiselle
came, and gently touched his hand to
remind him that he was not alone in his sorrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
He neither felt the fraternity nor the unspoken
tenderness. The paleness of her cheek held no
eloquence of suffering for him; the sadness of
her eyes left his heart untouched. As for the
child, far from feeling a thrill of paternity upon
sight of it, he desired never to behold it more.
He would regard it henceforth as the cause of
his moral ruin, the beginning of a broken and
joyless life.</p>

<p>In this hard and sullen mood he returned to
Paris, and Gabrielle grew up with Mademoiselle,
without any knowledge of her father, who apparently
had forgotten the existence of both.

  <h3 class="nobreak" id="AN_INTERLUDE">AN INTERLUDE
  <br>
  <span class="small">A DECISION FIN DE SIÈCLE AT THE CAFÉ LANDER</span>
 </h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I<b>N</b></span> the middle of the rue Taitbout, there is a
little café, which was not so well known twenty
years ago as it is now, at the end of the nineteenth
century. Then it was only beginning to
emerge from the inferior position of crémerie.
Came one day, from the unconventional region
of the Latin Quarter, somewhere in the seventies,
an enterprising proprietor; and in his wake
followed a train of noble youths, enthusiastic
in the praises of Lander, wishful for the further
enjoyments of his hospitalities, and with kindly
memory of his generosity in the matter of
credit.</p>

<p>Lander brought the pleasant ways of the
<i>Quarter</i> across the town with him, and the
band of noble youths stood by him, encouraged
and sustained him. In consequence, the Café
Lander flourished exceedingly, and its circle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
clients daily increased, until it was known, far
and wide, as the resort of embryo genius. For
all the boisterous and good-tempered young
fellows who crowded round its tables, and
emptied bocks and consumed coffee (fifty centimes
a cup with <i>fine champagne</i>), were coming
great men. They were the future lights in
literature, art, philosophy, and politics. The
real living great man they professed to regard
with respectful admiration, but they wanted
none of him in their midst. In the slang of
the day, he had made his pile, and reposed on
velvet and laurels among the Immortals. When
he would have become a part of the past, and
the future was their present, they could afford
to be on more intimate terms with him. But
for the present, they belonged exclusively to
the future.</p>

<p>These young fools had their place a while,
and expectation dwelt indulgently upon them.
They chatted loudly of isms and ologies and
oxies, with refreshing crudeness: upheld the
realistic, the romantic, the psychological, and
Heaven knows what other schools of literature.
They prated of form, and matter, and art, and
style, as only Frenchmen, bitten by love of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
these things, can prate. And then, one by one,
they dropped out of the ranks of embryo genius,
having accomplished nothing, with the great
epic unwritten, unwritten the drama, the psychological
novel that was to teach M. Bourget
something new about women; unwritten the
important <i>History of the Franks</i>, that was to
throw into relief hitherto unrevealed aspects of
the character of their conquerors; unsolved
the problems of metaphysics under discussion,
undiscovered the great political panacea of the
age, unpainted the grand masterpiece. With
the first stone of their reputation still to be
laid, they went, and the café saw them no more.</p>

<p>Some of them became commonplace advocates,
and made uninteresting citizens and
fairly reputable fathers of families: or sordid
notaries, or humdrum bourgeois. Romance
shook its bridle rein with a regretful backward
glance: ‘Farewell for evermore,’ and the converted
fool turned upon his heel to enter into
the ignoble strife with his fellows in quest of
daily bread. Others there were who had a
troublesome way of right-about-facing upon
fond expectation. They jilted the muse for
historical research, or discarded art for literature,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
or drifted from sonnets to the stage. One
youth of philosophic tastes was known, with
inexcusable fickleness, to shake off the secular
garb, and array himself in the white of the
cloister. He was the only one who made a
serious reputation; he became a fashionable
preacher, and wrote a <i>History of the Church</i>
which brought upon him the wrath of Rome.</p>

<p>But if they were mostly crude, ineffectual
youths, they had bright faces, and eager
glances, and hearts full of hope and enthusiasm.
They were each confident of his
own powers, inapprehensive of defeat or failure,
bound upon a fiery race for experience and
new sensations, contemptuous of the past,
and looked gaily toward a future of glorious
achievement. Not a city but furnishes the
type, and in no other city is it so persistent
as in Paris. Paint one such, and you paint all
her young men, nourished upon vivid imagination,
upon inexhaustible hope and unconquerable
self-faith.</p>

<p>Into this circle of frank and amiable egotists,
Dr. Vermont dropped accidentally some ten
years ago. Being of an experimental turn of
mind, and apt to fall upon mild curiosity in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his casual scrutiny of impetuous youth, he
stayed. It is a mistake to assume that an
interest in youth, and a tolerance of its nonsense,
is an indication of lingering kindness of
heart Dr. Vermont liked youth as a vivisectionist
likes animals. It taught him much
that he desired to know, and where it did not
teach him precisely, it helped him along the
path of observation. Men are grown-up children;
boys are rude philosophers, artists, poets,
what you will.</p>

<p>A cold, passionless man was Dr. Vermont,
the one feeble flame of human feeling he had
thrilled to having faded out of memory almost
upon the death of his just buried young wife.
She, too, had interested him, only differently,
being of a less calculable and possibly less
shallow order of being than the embryo great
men of Lander’s. Widowhood had sundered
him sharply from all personal ties, and left
him all the freer to indulge his passion for experimental
psychology.</p>

<p>As he sat evening after evening, and drank his
coffee and little glass, and smoked a meditative
cigar, it amused him to encourage the vivacious
contentment around him, and lead the unborn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
reputations to reveal their bent. His influence
upon young men was a thing to make older
and saner persons gape. It was, perhaps, all
the stronger and more subtle because it was
unrecognised. He was feared, and yet admired,
to an incredible degree. His mild, sarcastic
face, with its finished features and wholly
effaced humanity of expression, put a point
upon emulation and goaded to rash display.
But none were made to feel the rashness of
their flights, or the absurdity of their theories.
Dr. Vermont was too clever a man to scare expansion,
or cow ambition. This was how he kept
his hold upon the fresh-moustached lads around
him. This was how they spoke of him among
themselves as a good fellow—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un bon garçon,
malgré</i>—well, in spite of a great many things.</p>

<p>Thus he sat, and smoked, and listened, while
the years passed, and out of the circle familiar
faces went and new ones came. It must be admitted
there was not much variety in the entertainment.
Always the same questions of form
and expression, of style and matter; always the
same comparison of international literatures and
the relative virtues of different forms of government;
above and beyond all, sex and its unexplained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and stinging problems. They never
tired, and each batch came up, fresh and eager for
the old discussions. Names may vary, fashions
may alter, but the rough, broad facts of life are
there, immutable like nature, ever recurrent
like the ebb and flow of the tide.</p>

<p>A sense of weariness was upon Dr. Vermont
the December night I write of, as he walked
toward the Café Lander. Most of the lads
were dispersed by the Christmas vacation. But
he knew precisely those who were expecting
him. Anatole Buzeval, his favourite, a charming
young fellow, with healthy Norman blood
in his veins, and in spite of the disastrous
environment of Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de siècle</i>, with something
throbbing under his coat that suspiciously
resembled a boy’s free heart. He came from
a Norman fishing town, near the beat of the
channel, washed by a friendly old river and
wooded by still friendlier trees. In boyhood,
he had walked in the woods, he had fished in
the river, he had known the delights of amateur
seafaring, and rode, and shot live things, and
was first awakened by love to the melody of
the birds, and to heroism by the genial spirit of
endurance of the fishermen. These influences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
kept him partially sheltered from the century-worn
cynicism and exhausted emotions prevailing.
It accounted for the ring of sincerity
in his laughter, for the zest of his ephemeral
enthusiasms and the courageous freedom of
his blue eyes. But he was nevertheless bitten
by the disease of the hour, and his speech was
tainted with the cheap <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de siècle</i> indifference
and dejection. He was the youngest of the
party, the most intelligent and the brightest.
Beside him sat Gaston Favre, a youth who
would have been an artist if the death-throes
of the century left him any room to believe in
art. Nothing any longer interested him, but
he was still capable of remarking upon sight of
a bad picture—</p>

<p>‘Now, if it were worth the trouble, or really
mattered, there is food for indignation in that
picture.’</p>

<p>Whereupon he would survey it in the spirit
of ostentatious tolerance, without a wince or a
critical flash of eye.</p>

<p>The third, Julien Renaud, was a little older
than these two, and professed a dead interest
in politics. Time was when Lander’s echoed
with the noble flow of his eloquence. Time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
was when it was confidently believed that he
was destined, not only in his own imagination,
to reach the tribune, and thunder effectively
against the abuses of government. But that
was in M. Constans’ hour, and M. Constans was
notoriously Julien’s pet aversion. In those
remote days, he was antagonistic toward what
he called ‘the whole shop of the Elysian Fields,’
and relished M. Carnot as little as he had ever
relished ‘old Father Grévy.’ But these were
now half-forgotten ebullitions of youth, and like
his beloved France, he was battered and bruised
by the defeats of life into complete indifference.
Nothing mattered. In reply to everything, he
had but one response, a quiet shrug, a weariedly
lifted eyebrow, and a murmured <i  lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui bono</i> upon
a long-drawn sigh. On this evening the chosen
drink was punch, which resulted in more boisterous
converse, and showed Anatole in almost
a lyric mood. The first mention of the insipidly
recurrent phrase of the hour—‘end
of the century’—inspired him to fall upon
mirthful reminiscences, just as Dr. Vermont
entered the café.</p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘M. le docteur désire?’</span> said the waiter,
helping him off with his overcoat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The doctor named his drink as he took a
seat, and blandly scrutinised each flushed and
smiling face.</p>

<p>‘We were talking, Doctor,’ Anatole cried, ‘of
ways of ending the year. Do you remember,
two years ago, when I first joined you, coming
straight from Barbizon, where I chummed with
a queer and amusing Scotch artist? how I
taught you all to sing what I conceived to be a
Scotch melody—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Temps Jadis</i>—and we
drank at midnight an execrable decoction called
in Scotland a tod-dy, standing, and gave an
English shake-hands all round, which I am
told is the way in Scotland of toasting the
departing year?’</p>

<p>The Doctor paused in the act of lifting his
glass, and nodded, as he threw out a couple
of absent names in signification of his keen
remembrance of the evening.</p>

<p>Followed good-natured and regretful words
for each absent face. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les temps jadis</i> were not
such bad times after all, though the melancholy
Scotch might chant them with more melody
than the vivacious sons of Gaul. Jean this was
an excellent heart; Henri that, a capital good
fellow, the pity was he stuttered so. Frédéric,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
poor fool, had settled down, and married a <i>dot</i>
and a squint, and the squint, alas! was so
marked, that the dowry was a totally inadequate
compensation. Upon which, Julien
made cynical mention of the greater security
of marital rights when backed by aid so powerful
as a squint.</p>

<p>‘But, since women are only happy in virtue
of their lovers and not in virtue of their husbands,’
shouted Anatole, with a charming look
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouerie</i>, ‘what a dismal future for Frédéric’s
wife! I declare I could find it in my heart to
rush off and console her. I should be so blinded
by my own burning eloquence, as I flung myself
at her feet, that I would have no eyes left for
the squint.’</p>

<p>‘Not until you came to yourself in a revulsion
of feeling, my friend,’ sneered Julien Renaud.</p>

<p>‘Has any one seen Henri Lemaître since the
night we drank our Scotch tod-dy, Anatole,
and sang, or tried to sing, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Temps Jadis</i>?’
asked Dr. Vermont.</p>

<p>‘No. He was last heard of in Japan,
studying the gentle art of self-defence, as
practised by the gentle Japanese. He derided
the duel, and loathed European pugilism, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
he thought something might be done towards a
more civilised settlement of disputes by borrowing
of the remoter civilisation of the land of
the chrysanthemum. What will you? Did he
not study the washy water-colours of the
immortal Monsieur Loti?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, an affection for Pierre Loti would explain
any absurdity!’ said Gaston Favre, with a grim
smile. ‘If we could hope to sit here a hundred
years hence, and make a summary of the gods
of the coming century, I wonder what sort of
intellectual company should we have under discussion.’</p>

<p>‘Finished humbugs, I dare swear,’ shouted
Anatole. ‘Already, from force of mere good
writing, we have fallen upon intellectual inanition.
The last century wound up by unveiling
the goddess of reason; we’ve unveiled the goddess
of form, and the devil swallow me, if there
is anything to be found behind our excellent
style. Each light of a new school sounds a
loud trumpet to inform the world that he has
at last discovered truth. So does a silly hen
who lays an ordinary egg, the counterpart of
her fellow-hen’s. You can’t convince her of the
fatuous impertinence of her cackle, nor prove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to her that there is nothing particularly great in
the laying of eggs. I declare, nowadays, every
trumpery artist and scribbler takes himself as
seriously as the hen, and divides his time between
laying and cackling.’</p>

<p>‘Each one has his theory, and it is more important
that he should reveal that theory to the
public than even paint his picture, write his
play, or novel, or story upon it. So much has
America taught him by means of that strange
institution, the interviewer.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ cried Anatole, in a burst of exaggerated
despair, ‘I gave up France when she took the
American interviewer to her bosom, and the
best papers were not ashamed to give us the
opinions of the latest Minister, and expose the
lack of taste and modesty in the youngest
Master.’</p>

<p>‘Not France alone, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cher</i>,’ interposed Dr.
Vermont; ‘English journalism has become no
whit less vulgar and personal. Vulgarity,
ostentation, fraud, rapacious advertisement—these
are all the symptoms of the great moral
disease of the century. Were a Lycurgus to
rise up for each state, I doubt if the nations of
the earth would have the wisdom to return to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
frugality, courage, and simplicity—so much have
we lost by the long race of civilisation, so much
our superiors were the old Pagan Spartans, and
so dead are we to all promptings of delicacy,—without
moral or physical value, without even
valour.’</p>

<p>The Doctor spoke dejectedly, as if the hope
of all good had died within him. The young
men suddenly remembered that they, too, were
weighted with a like lassitude and unbelief, and
finished their punch in silence.</p>

<p>‘I expect we shall see the century out in a
lugubrious spirit,’ sighed Anatole, when, upon
a sign from Dr. Vermont, the waiter had replenished
their glasses.</p>

<p>‘Where’s the use of facing a new one?’ asked
the Doctor, with a vague, dull glance into space.
‘The same chatter, the same humbug, the
same vulgarity and fraud. Always the same,
and inevitably the same. New idols, new
theories, new habits start up to prove more
monotonous than the old ones——’</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,’
interrupted Gaston Favre.</p>

<p>‘Exactly, and Alphonse Karr was not the
first to find it out. I have a better plan, lads,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
for saluting the new century than your Scotchman’s
tod-dy and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Temps Jadis</i>,—than even
the insipid shake-hands of Albion.’</p>

<p>The punch had gone to the young heads, and
gave them a craving for excitement. Each one
leant forward over his glass, with shining eyes
and flushed cheeks, eager and expectant. It
was not often that Dr. Vermont condescended
to plan for their amusement.</p>

<p>‘Let us suppose ourselves singing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Neiges
d’Antan</i>, and toasting our old acquaintances.
We shall awaken into a new century, just the
same as the old. The more it changes, the
more it will be the same. Are you not prospectively
tired of it already?’</p>

<p>He looked round gravely upon the young
men, and excitement died out of each glance
under the sad indifference of his. They felt upon
their honour to be no less weary and cynical
than he. A nod of emphatic agreement from
the three young pessimists was supplemented
to the Doctor’s monologue, as he continued—</p>

<p>‘Suppose we salute the twentieth century—already
worn before birth—by a single pistol-shot,
the mouth of each man’s to his brains.
As we are none of us likely to do anything with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
our brains, more than the hundreds of other
young men I have seen vanish from these tables
into nothingness, there can be no patriotic
objection to our blowing them out in company.’</p>

<p>The young men sat back in their chairs, and
drew a long, deep breath. They were almost
sobered for the moment, and profoundly troubled
by their leader’s extraordinary proposition.
However firmly we may be convinced of the
nothingness of life, such a method of toasting
the new year is calculated to give the stoutest
courage pause. Not that they held any
squeamish objections to suicide—quite the
contrary, they professed to regard it as the
natural and legitimate remedy for a broken
heart, damaged honour, or a ruined life. But,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tudieu!</i> they all sat there drinking their punch
in freedom and security, with pockets not inconveniently
full, it is true, but with sound
hearts and sounder appetites. The prison was
not before them: then, why the deuce should
they be offered the grave?</p>

<p>‘I thought, like Solomon, you were disposed
to complain of the sameness of all things under
the sun,’ sneered the Doctor.</p>

<p>‘That is true, Doctor,’ assented Anatole.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
‘But suppose we were to find things just as
same beyond the sun—or a good deal worse?
For, after all, we may flatter ourselves with
being sceptics, but what security have we that
the pistol-shot will be the end of it all? and
what if it happened to be infernally disagreeable
somewhere else, and there was no getting
back?’</p>

<p>‘Bah, another glass of punch will put you all
right,’ laughed Julien. ‘On reflection, I find the
Doctor’s proposal an excellent one. We are
sick of everything here—wine, women, and song,
such as Paris now furnishes. Then, let us go
and see for ourselves what is going on among
the stars. There’s this comfort, Anatole, we go
in a body, if there is anything ugly to face.
That’s the difficulty about suicide,—its lugubrious
solitude. In company, one may snap his
fingers at fear. To see three friendly faces
round you, all ready to plunge at once into the
same boat, and exchange jokes simultaneously
with old Father Charon! When you lift your
own cocked pistol to your forehead, to see three
other hands and all four be shot together
out of the mystery, either into eternity or—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
néant</i>.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah, there, you’re not sure either, Gaston,’
Anatole protested, reproachfully.</p>

<p>‘That’s just it, boy; I know nothing now,
but with the dawn of the new century I should
know everything.’</p>

<p>‘My humble contribution to the Doctor’s plan
is the proposal that we blow our brains out
together—I mean in the same room,’ suggested
Julien.</p>

<p>‘Precisely; I have just been thinking the
matter out. Now here in Paris, we should
excite excessive attention. But it might better
be managed in some quiet place—near the sea,
or close to a river bank, where our bodies might
disappear easily, without giving rise to immediate
alarm. I know of a half deserted island
down near Beaufort, my native town. You will
hardly believe that a place so near a busy
factory town—one of the largest provincial
cities of France—could be so forsaken and
desolate. I doubt if any one lives on it now.
My father-in-law had a big gloomy house on
that island. I don’t think there was another
inhabitant but himself. We might go down
there, and toast the new century in among the
dark rocks above the river.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>‘Beaufort! a commonplace train with such
an end in view,’ sighed Anatole.</p>

<p>‘Not necessarily a train. What is to prevent
us from taking horse, as your favourite heroes
of Dumas did?’ said the Doctor, smiling a little
at him.</p>

<p>‘With all my heart, if we are going to ride to
Beaufort,’ cried Anatole. ‘I don’t care if I am
shot then.’

  DR. VERMONT</h3>

  <p class="center">(<i>Told by the author</i>)</p>

  <h4 class="nobreak">DR. VERMONT AND HIS GUESTS UPON
  THE ISLAND</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>T</b></span> wanted three days to the end of the year.
The afternoon had been so exceptionally mild,
that Mademoiselle Lenormant and her foreign
friend were still sitting out on the gallery enjoying
the sunset. The air was very clear, and
the heavens beautifully coloured, though the
winter dusk was beginning to drop. But it
was as yet a mere suggestion of dimness that
did not hide, while it accentuated, the edge of
bleak and empty road along the sky-line. It
sharpened the outlines of the bridge and its
castellated points below. The river was smooth
like dark glass, and rosy clouds made a blood-red
margin along its outer bank. No wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
blew among the trees of the melancholy garden,
visible from the other side of the gallery, and
so still was it, that the farthest sounds sent
back their travelling echoes. The footfall of
a solitary peasant crossing the bridge made a
martial clatter, so clear and strong and self-assertive
was it upon the pavements that seemed
to sleep since feudal times.</p>

<p>Little Gabrielle sat in a corner of the gallery
in jacket and hood, hugging Minette, who bore
the discomfort bravely, while she spelled out a
story from a large picture-book on her knee.
It was satisfactory to see that the kitten took
as much interest in the story as the reader, and
enlivened the study by occasional lunges at the
brown finger following each line. The child’s
pretty voice hardly interrupted the low conversation
of the two ladies, who faced the view
of Beaufort, and watched the road, while they
discoursed upon the philosophy of life. Mademoiselle
Lenormant always watched that road,
whether she sat in the gallery or upstairs in
her own room. It was the rival of Gabrielle
and her books, for she would willingly leave
either at any moment to look at it.</p>

<p>Joséphine came down to carry Gabrielle inside,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
out of the chill air, and the child was still
protesting loudly, and calling imperiously on
her aunt to rescue her from private tyranny,
when Mademoiselle bent forward with an excited
gesture, her eyes riveted upon the point
where the road seemed to issue from the sky.</p>

<p>‘Do you not see something down there—something
dark that moves?’ she breathed,
without looking at her companion.</p>

<p>‘Effectively. It appears to be a group of
men on horseback. Yes, Mademoiselle, it is a
party of riders, and they are coming straight
towards the bridge.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle shook from head to foot, and
went and caught the balustrade to steady herself,
while she continued to examine the blot
of moving shadow upon the landscape, that
increased with each wink of eyelid, until soon
it was a visible invasion of males on horseback.
A dull thud of hoofs was borne upon the air,
and near the bridge, one of the party, apparently
the leader, drew up, and seemed to address the
others. These at once fell behind, three in
number, and the foremost turned his face to
the island, and galloped ahead.</p>

<p>‘Joséphine, viens, viens vite,’ shrieked Mademoiselle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
her whole face dyed pink, and her
grey eyes dark and luminous with emotion.</p>

<p>Joséphine hurried out, cap-strings flying, all
in a state of wild concern. What was it, but
what on earth was it? What did Mademoiselle
see?</p>

<p>Mademoiselle began in a thick voice—</p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Je crois, Joséphine, que c’est le docteur’</span>—and
then stopped, and drew her hand slowly across
her eyes, like one awakened from a moment’s
stupor. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘C’est Monsieur le docteur qui nous
arrive enfin,’</span> she added, in her usual voice, and
with a full return to her old self.</p>

<p>Joséphine peered over the balustrade, but she
only saw three moving shapes upon the bridge,
the outlines of horse and man intermelted to
her vision.</p>

<p>‘The foremost rider must now be half way
up the street,’ cried Mademoiselle’s companion,
glad yet ashamed that she should be there at
such a moment.</p>

<p>‘Take Gabrielle, Joséphine, and put on her
pretty grey dress and her laces. Marie will
open the door for Dr. Vermont.’</p>

<p>Joséphine carried off the startled child, too
frightened to ask questions or demur, and at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
that moment the bell rang loudly, with violent
emphasis.</p>

<p>‘I will leave you now, dear Mademoiselle,’
said her friend, with sympathetic pressure of
her fingers. ‘Monsieur will doubtless require
this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i>, in which case I can return to
Beaufort this evening.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, there is a bedroom upstairs. You
will not leave me so abruptly, not now, when
perhaps I may most need a friend. Stay yet
a while.’</p>

<p>A heavy step was crossing the hall, and
came through the dining-room towards the
gallery. The foreigner, on her way to her own
room, caught sight of a lean, youngish-looking
gentleman, with a fair beard and thin brown
hair worn off temples, deeply marked by life.
He glanced at her keenly, as he stood for her
to pass, and she had time to note the social
polish of his manners, and the melancholy
dignity of his aspect, and then he crossed the
floor and stepped out through the window,
searching with mild brown eyes for the woman
who had waited for his coming for ten long
years.</p>

<p>His face lit up with a soft smile when he saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
her, and he went forward, upon the pleasant
exclamation—‘Ma sœur!’ His intention was
to bestow upon her a formal embrace. His
hand was stretched out, and when her cold
slim fingers touched it, and lay in his palm,
and he saw the lustre of unshed tears in the
sad grey eyes that met his own steadily, and
a rosy flame tremble like confession over the
cheeks’ pallor, a new impulse came to him, and
he simply lifted her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Henriette,’ he murmured, in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>‘The silence has been long, François,’ she
said, and smiled.</p>

<p>He still held her hand, and gazed at her
curiously. She was not so changed as he, and
if the years had thinned, they had not lined
her face. At thirty-three, he even found her
more attractive than at twenty. There was
that about her which compelled interest, and
gave an odd charm to the simplest speech.</p>

<p>‘Henriette, you have much to pardon me, and
your indulgence will have to go still further than
you dream. Ah, how vividly a forgotten past
may bear down upon a man at the first sight of
a familiar place! All my life down here had
clean gone from my mind. This queer old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
house, your father, you, even Adèle, have been
for me years past, not even a memory, much
less a link with all that is gone. It is incredible
how completely a man may forget. No regret,
no remembrance pursued me in Paris, and the
instant I crossed the bridge it all surged back
on me, not as remembered days, but as the actual
present. Verily, we are droll rascals, Henriette,
and mercilessly tyrannised by experience.’</p>

<p>He had dropped her hand now, and was
leaning against a pillar, staring across at Beaufort.
Mademoiselle’s brows twitched sharply,
but she uttered no word of reproach, partly
from pride, and partly from surprise.</p>

<p>‘It will be good news for Gabrielle, and for
me, if such a change decided you to remain
here now,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Gabrielle?’ he interrogated softly.</p>

<p>‘Your child, François!’</p>

<p>Oh, this he understood as a reproach, though
it touched him but slightly. He made a step
forward, still questioning her with movement
of brow and eyelid.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens!</i> It is true. Is it credible I could
forget I had a child? Oh! I know what you
must think of me, Henriette; and the worst of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
it is, you cannot think badly enough of me;’ he
said, laughing drearily.</p>

<p>‘It would be a poor satisfaction for me to
think badly of you, François. I am not your
judge. It is enough for me that you have come
back—at last.’</p>

<p>‘What a sweet woman!’ cried Dr. Vermont,
in amazement. ‘My sister, your kindness confounds
me. Life has not taught me to expect
anything like it, and I begin to believe I am
not the sage I have lately loved to contemplate.
What, indeed, if these steadfast, silent creatures
be the sages after all, and we, the philosophers
and seekers after light, but the fools, who wear
cap and bells, and mistake them for badges of
sovereignty.’</p>

<p>‘Here comes Gabrielle, François,’ said Mademoiselle,
interrupting his reflections.</p>

<p>The little girl lingered shyly upon the edge
of the gallery, which Joséphine endeavoured to
make her cross by whispered entreaty and
pushes. She did not know this man who was
her father, and her small brains were busy contriving
a way to greet him. She made a pretty
picture thus, in grey silk and white lace, with a
broad crimson sash, and a big bow of red ribbon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
on the top of her curly brown head. Dr. Vermont
stared at her as an object of natural
curiosity rather than a charming little girl, his
own daughter.</p>

<p>‘She is very like you, Henriette,’ he said, and
held out his hand with an ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>Gabrielle came slowly forward, and took it;
then looked up into his face in grave and
silent deliberation. She decided suddenly to
offer her cheek for the paternal kiss, which she
did, with much conscious dignity and no sense
of pleasure whatever.</p>

<p>‘Let me see,’ said Dr. Vermont, when he had
perfunctorily kissed her, ‘she is now about ten.
The very age her mother was when I first
beheld her. Poor pretty Adèle! She does
not in any way resemble her.’</p>

<p>He sighed deeply, and Henriette’s eyes, fixed
on Gabrielle, filled with tears.</p>

<p>‘What rooms does Monsieur wish me to prepare
for him?’ Joséphine asked in the pause.</p>

<p>The Doctor started, and remembered, with
a quick disagreeable sensation, the nearness of
his friends, and its extraordinary significance.
If that good soul Joséphine but knew! If
Henriette suspected!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>‘That reminds me, Henriette—I have left
three friends outside. I suppose you can put
us up down here, or upstairs, for a couple of
nights?’</p>

<p>‘Only a couple of nights?’ Mademoiselle
exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Yes. By the dawn of New Year’s Day we
shall be far from Beaufort, so we will leave you
on New Year’s Eve after dinner. What accommodation
have you here?’</p>

<p>‘You have forgotten that, too! There is
your old room—the large one opposite, which
a friend of mine has been using. There is a
canapé, which one of the gentlemen can sleep
on. And then there is my sister’s room, and
in the little dressing-room off it, another bed
could be put up. I think you can manage.’</p>

<p>‘Capitally. We shall be lodged like kings.
Gaston and Julien in my old room—yes, I quite
remember it now. Yellow hangings, and an
engraving of Da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” and a
picture of Madame Lebrun. Not so? Anatole
will sleep in the dressing-room, and I in the
blue room. Is it still so blue? There used to
be a photograph of my favourite Del Sarto,
“The Madonna with St John.” Poor Adèle!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
What would I not give to be the same enamoured
young fellow of ten years ago, violently
combating death? But I have lived twenty
years since, and everything is dead for me.’</p>

<p>He thrust his hands into his pockets, and
went toward the door in search of his friends,
without troubling to note the effect of his
heartless words upon Henriette.</p>

<p>These he found trotting unconcernedly up
and down the broken pavement. With all
eternity before them, a few minutes more or
less outside a particular door could not affect
them. And when they were ushered into the
house by the Doctor, and presented to his
sister-in-law, they cast a glance of pity upon
her that she should be at so much pains to
welcome doomed, indifferent men. They listened
politely to her apologies for the insufficiencies
of their installation, and to her prayers
for indulgence in the matter of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisine</i>; and
shook their heads in despondent wonder. As
for Anatole, he was as lugubrious as a funeral
mute, and the Doctor’s cynical animation at
table completely mystified him.</p>

<p>When once the fumes of punch had abated,
poor Anatole saw his mad engagement in quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
a novel light. The thought of that pistol held
by his own hand to his own brains drove him
to panic. He looked wan with fear, and fierce
from desire to conceal his fear. He was a
coward in both senses: without courage to
stand out against a foolish engagement, and
equally without courage to face death. Despite
his boasted conviction that one death is as
good as another, and any possibly better than
life, he entertained a very private notion that
suicide is a social as well as a moral crime,
hardly justifiable by the most abject blunder
and excesses—and by nothing less than absolute
dishonour.</p>

<p>Besides, at heart he loved life, and he only
played at pessimism not to look less jaded and
cynical than the rest of the century. It was
the fashion not to be gay, to have no belief, to
have exhausted all emotions, and reached the
end of all things. Now what would those
around him say if it were known that Anatole
Buzeval relished in the privacy of his own
chamber Alexandre Dumas, and shed tears at
the death of Porthos? What self-respecting
Parisian of his day would associate with a
youth, whose favourite hero was D’Artugnan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and who loved the great optimist Scott, whose
novels he studied stealthily in an indifferent
translation, and knew by heart.</p>

<p>He was abashed by contemplation of his
own spuriousness as member of an effete circle,
where death was regarded as the best of all
things; and Mademoiselle Lenormant was
seriously distressed by the wretchedness of his
appetite and the misery of his boyish face.
She forgot herself in another, and left the
Doctor to entertain her friend, who had been
invited to join them at dinner, while she set
herself the task of rescuing the poor lad from
his own reflections. Anatole was an affectionate
and grateful young fellow, and the way to his
heart was inconveniently easy of access. When
he went to bed that night, to his other woes
was added the delightful misfortune of being
head and ears in love with the Doctor’s sister-in-law.</p>

<p>This was a complication not unnoted by Dr.
Vermont or his companions. The Doctor
calmly stroked his beard, and watched Anatole
between the pauses of his conversation on
matters English with the foreign lady. The
foreigner, he was pleased afterwards to describe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
as intelligent, but as she had already touched
the rim of the arid plain of middle-age, with
equal dulness, far from the hills of youth and
from the valley of old age, he saw no reason to
pursue her thoughts or shades of speech upon
her face—by the way, he did not like English
women; they lacked <i>atmosphere</i>, and were born
without any natural grace, or coquetry, or any
desire to please—and hence he had the more
leisure to devote to inspection of Mademoiselle
Lenormant and his susceptible comrade. He
understood all the boy thought hidden of the
struggle within him. He contemplated a magnanimous
turn at the last moment, and caressed
it in all its dramatic details. Meanwhile, it
amused him to follow the conflict, and watch
the childish eagerness with which Anatole,
thinking his last hour at hand, abandoned
himself to this new fancy, with a volume of
eloquent declaration on the edge of his eyelids.</p>

<p>And yet the Doctor’s calm inspection was
not without a twinge of anger, as at a kind of
infringement of his personal rights. As he sat
in the old salon, where in his youth he used to
chat with Monsieur Lenormant, he was in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
grip of the past, softened, almost sentimental.
Nothing was changed about the place, which
wore the same homely aspect of shabbiness
and comfortable untidiness. But three of the
personages of that little drama were dead:
Monsieur Lenormant, Adèle, and young Dr.
Vermont. For he, too, had been young and
bright and pleasant. Once he had thrilled
from head to foot when Adèle, with a charming
movement, took one of his long fingers, and
helped him to vamp the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>, and
their eyes met in a foolish fluttering glance,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tudieu!</i> his own were wet!</p>

<p>These were extraordinary things to remember,
perhaps, but not so extraordinary as the
persistence with which his backward glance
rested, not on the image of his lovely young
wife evoked from the past—but upon Henriette
as she then was. That picture of grave, silent
girlhood haunted him in a singular and unexpected
way. The forgotten drama rose up,
and confronted him with its ruthless <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i>.
And if he were not too proud and wilful
ever to acknowledge regret, he might know
that it was there the sting lay, as he remembered:
that he should have played an ignoble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
trick upon poor old Monsieur Lenormant, and
have looked at Adèle instead of at Henriette—on
one memorable occasion. He had played
for his happiness, and happiness had passed
him by. Perchance, had he played a more
honourable game, happiness would have been
with him all these years, and the noble woman,
whose suffering in his choice he now knew he
had then divined, would have brought him
finer and more delicate enjoyment than that
which he had found elsewhere.</p>

<p>‘Yet who knows?’ he added, as a sound lash
upon sentimental musing. ‘There is no such
thing as happiness, and I should have tired of
her goodness as I have tired of the badness of
others.’</p>

<p>But he smiled indulgently, when Anatole
droned a melancholy melody upon her charms
that night.

<p><span class="smcap">W<b>HILE</b></span> the young men were still sitting over
their coffee and rolls in uncheerful converse, Dr.
Vermont stole upstairs—not to see Gabrielle,
but to talk to Henriette. His thoughts had
been with her all night, and he was eager for
sight of her by day.</p>

<p>When he entered, a spot of insufferable radiance
burnt into the hollow of her thin cheek;
but this confession was counteracted by the
extreme sadness of her greeting. She, too, had
thought during the night, and thought had
cruelly struck at her life-long idol. For had he
not forgotten Adèle? and was Adèle’s child
anything more than his by name? To have
found him indifferent to her because of the
dead! But to find him indifferent to both!
There was the point of pain, and with it the
wrench of a wounded faith, which could never
more uphold her in her solitude.</p>

<p>She looked at him anxiously, to see if a night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
spent in the blue room had stamped his cynical,
handsome face with a trace of suffering, of revived
feeling. The poor lady could not be
expected to interpret any such sign except as
homage to her dead sister. So she lifted up
her heart in honest gratitude for the touch of
humanity in his manner as he held Gabrielle to
his knee, and stroked her brown hair gently.
Such is the guileness and simplicity to be found
on a forsaken island, where gossip is not, and
society revelations are unknown.</p>

<p>‘And you have lived here the old quiet life,
Henriette, with no thought of marriage or
change,’ the Doctor said musingly, and noted
with pleasure the charming habit of blushing
she had retained, like a very young girl.</p>

<p>‘Surely, François, you would have expected
to be apprised of my marriage, or of any other
change?’</p>

<p>‘I? Why should I? Had I not of my own
will dropped out of your existence? If I chose
to forget our relationship, what claim on your
courtesy could I urge? You are too sensitive,
too loyal, too good, Henriette. You were
always that. Your father used to say so, and
so used Adèle. Ah! they loved you well—those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
two. I wish now for your sake—I
honestly wish you had dealt me the measure I
deserved, and my neglect would have stung you
less.’</p>

<p>‘It did not sting me, François. I have no
pride of that kind. Life is too full of pain.
But I was sorry and grieved for Gabrielle’s
sake.’</p>

<p>Had she not the right to hide the rest from
him—simple-minded lady? who believed she
had succeeded—since she so honourably strove
to hide it from herself? Dr. Vermont pushed
the child away, and came and stood before his
sister-in-law. His imperious glance compelled
hers, which she lifted timidly, apprehensively.</p>

<p>‘You are an angel, Henriette—oh, I don’t mean
in the hackneyed conventional sense, but as a
man means it when the goodness of another
forces him to face right and wrong, and he feels
he cannot undo the wrong and cannot choose
the right. It is a miserable position. Ah! if
it were not so late? But my tongue is tied.
My first mistake was here, in this very room,
years ago—twenty, thirty, a lifetime may be.
Your father lay on the canapé dying, and I was
sitting beside him. He spoke of you; I knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
well that he spoke of you, though he did not
mention your name. It was you he wished me
to marry, and I, following his glance, looked at
Adèle instead. Happiness seemed to woo me
from that flower-like face, and I believed in
happiness then. Now!’ he shrugged in his expressive
way, and added, in a softer voice,
drooping humbly to her: ‘God forgive me,
Henriette, but now I question the wisdom of
that choice.’</p>

<p>‘It was a natural choice, François, and it
would be anguish for me to think that you
could regret it. Spare me that sorrow. Surely
I have suffered enough, and have not reproached
you. But this indignity would indeed give
voice to the pain of silent years, and bid me
utter words neither you nor I could forget. I
gave her to you,’ she went on, in a dull tone of
protest. ‘It was the best I had, my dearest and
sole one on earth. But what did it matter if I
was the lonelier, so that you and she were happy
together? I have asked so little of life. Leave
me that remembrance, François. No man had
a sweeter wife than my Adèle, and for her I can
be satisfied with a loyalty no less from her husband
than that which I have given her.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>She glided from the room without another
look for him. He stood and stared after her,
with a fantastic, almost amused movement of
eyebrow, though the heart within him felt
heavy to bursting with an odd assortment of
sensations.</p>

<p>When they met again, it was at the luncheon
table, with his companions and Mademoiselle’s
foreign friend.</p>

<p>‘Anatole devours her with his eyes,’ he said
to himself. ‘Poor moth! he is sadly burnt, and
the fact that she is eight or nine years his
senior makes his hurt the graver. There are
compensations in a hopeless love when the ages
are reversed.’</p>

<p>But his mild sarcastic face wore no look of
dejection or dismay as he sat and discoursed
upon Shakespeare and Molière with the
foreigner, only of intelligent survey and an
amiable satisfaction in all things, including
the clowns of Shakespeare, from whom most
Frenchmen instinctively shrink. After lunch
they played chess and discussed, in the usual
way, the school of realists, décadents, symbolists,
and the recent revival of romanticism in a
gentleman, said to combine the melodious style
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of George Sand with the adventurous spirit of
the great Dumas. It was only when the
foreigner retired, and the young men went
upstairs to study the stars in the friendly odour
of tobacco, that the Doctor ventured again to
address Henriette.</p>

<p>‘He is an interesting lad, Anatole—eh?’</p>

<p>‘Very. But it distresses me to see him so
sad and worried at his age. He appears to
have some trouble on his mind,’ said Mademoiselle,
leaning her elbows on the table and
her chin upon her folded hands.</p>

<p>‘He has fallen in love with you—that’s his
trouble, Henriette. I assure you, up in Paris,
he is the reverse of sad or worried. He is the
life of Lander’s.’</p>

<p>Dr. Vermont achieved his purpose: he made
her blush from neck to forehead.</p>

<p>‘You forget, François, that you are talking
to a middle-aged woman of a very young man,’
she said, in surprise.</p>

<p>‘Not so middle-aged as that,’ laughed Dr.
Vermont, unjoyously. ‘And the others,—do
they appear to have any trouble on their
minds?’</p>

<p>‘It has not struck me. I should say they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
are rather futile men, who would probably fail
in any undertaking in an abject way,’ she said,
dismissing them.</p>

<p>But she did not dismiss Anatole from her
mind, and when he came to say ‘Good-night’
to her, she greeted him with so much direct and
personal sympathy in her smile, in her glance,
and in the slight pressure of her fingers, that I
declare the poor fellow was only restrained
by the presence of Dr. Vermont from bursting
into tears then and there, and confessing
all to her. Instead, he choked an inclination
to sob, and turned despairingly on his
heel.</p>

<p>It rained heavily all next day—the fatal New
Year’s Eve. With an instinct for dramatic
fitness, Anatole spent the first half in a state
of suppressed tearfulness, as an appropriate
ending of his young life. He was unrecognisable
to himself even, for never before had he
dropped into the elegiac mood. With the
lyric, with the martial, with the bacchanalian,
he was familiar enough. He tried to recover
his self-esteem by imagining what his state
would be on the battle-field. But the satisfaction
he might feel in shooting a German, or bayoneting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
an insolent Englishman, was wanting to
take from the horror of contemplated death;
and the candid wretchedness of his face provoked
sympathetic misery in the glance of all
who beheld him. What would he not give for
one more sight of the old fishing town in Normandy,
for a chat with the genial honest fishermen
who had never heard that accursed phrase,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fin de siècle</i>, and little cared whether they
were at the beginning or the end of the century.
No, if his mother were alive, he was convinced
he never would have entered into that wicked
jest upon matter so solemn as death. He
would have known better, had he even a sister,
like that sweet and noble-looking lady, Mademoiselle
Lenormant.</p>

<p>It was too late now, and this was his last day.
Thank God it rained! It rained so darkly and
so dismally that the regrets of life were mitigated
by the mournfulness of nature. It was
relieved thereby of much of its attraction and
of all its enchantment. Had a single ray of
sunlight fallen upon the damp earth, it would
have shaken him to the depth of his being.
This fact he jealously kept to himself, dreading
the sneer of those two superior young men,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Julien and Gaston, who thought themselves
such very fine fellows because they persisted in
their indifference to eternity, and cared not a
rush for the poor old world they were going
from. But Anatole knew better than to envy
them. He held that it requires but a bad heart,
or none at all, and feeble brains atrophied by
the cheap philosophy of the hour, to reach this
stage. So, while they smoked and joked downstairs
in dismal hilarity, he sat upstairs with the
ladies, and drank tea, and made a gallant effort
to play with little Gabrielle. How happy he
might be if this were to be permanent reality,
and Paris, with its unrest, its bitterness, its noise
and glitter, an ugly dream!</p>

<p>Dr. Vermont showed himself neither upstairs
nor downstairs. Before lunch he walked to Beaufort,
and on his return, he slowly made the tour
of the island. It had been mentioned that upon
one side of the island, as you stepped from the
bridge beyond a broken arch and a dangerous
reach of rocks down to the inky waters, there
was an old tower. Monsieur Lenormant’s
house was lower down on the opposite side,
facing the cemetery. This tower had been an
ancient fort when the entire isle was the fortified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
retreat of an illustrious and rebel house.
It had sustained sieges, and known the roar of
musketry, and it still stood nobly upon its
martial memories, albeit a ruin of centuries.
All was silence and desolation on this side of
the island. No one walked its pavements, and
the laundresses wheeling their barrows to town
from the lower end, instinctively chose the
inhabited quarter to pass.</p>

<p>‘A man might rot to carrion here,’ said
Dr. Vermont, as he stood between the battered
walls of the tower, and looked up at the weeping
heavens, and then down at the sullen and
swollen river. ‘None would know, and a few
days’ persistent rain would rush the river beyond
the rocks in among these ruins, and carry
our bodies away to the sea.’</p>

<p>And then he walked with his hands in his
pockets, unmindful of the rain, to the neglected
cemetery. He stood a while against the white
tomb of his young wife, upon which some
flowers lay, a lifeless pulp in a pool of water.
Thirty-nine only, and two days ago he believed
he had tasted all life had to offer, and wanted
no more of its bitterness or its sweetness? But
he would not humble himself to admit that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
had erred two days ago, and that there still
remained at the bottom of the cup a draught
he would willingly drink. He put the present
from him, and the stirring voice of a troubled
consciousness, and leaned there in the rain to
dream a while of youth, and hope, and all things
good that have been and are no more.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he returned
and shut himself in the blue-room to write
letters. This done, he examined a pair of
pistols, loaded one which he laid upon the table,
and with his odd, hard smile, carried the other
into the dressing-room where Anatole slept,
and placed it on the bed. There was still half
an hour to dispose of before dinner—his last
half hour of solitude. He took up the candle,
and walked slowly round the room, inspecting
each object, pricking by association, memory,
that just then needed no pricking. The pity was
that the man’s sharp face never lost its calm
irony of expression, and his shapely mouth
never lost its trick of quiet smiling. For him
absurdity lay at the bottom of all things—if
not absurdity, something so much worse as to
be beyond toleration.</p>

<p>Man in all his moods, he insisted, was a mixture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
of grossness and absurdity, and it mattered
little which of the two elements prevailed. The
one excess worked mischief for himself, and the
other mischief for his neighbours.</p>

<p>When the dinner-bell rang, Dr. Vermont
appeared still smiling and humorously observant.
He it was who spoke most, and most
coherently, at table. Julien and Gaston swaggered
a little, and their faces were pale and
excited. Anybody with an eye in his head
might have guessed they were morally perturbed,
and Mademoiselle, mindful of the
hurried departure that night, questioned her
foreign friend, sitting below with Dr. Vermont,
in a swift, apprehensive glance. But the
Doctor was so cool and steady, and discoursed
so blandly with his neighbour, that she dismissed
her fears, and set herself to cheer and
encourage poor Anatole. If his depression
were really due to a violent fancy for herself,
then she was in duty bound to act the part of
mother, or at least of elder affectionate sister,—which
she did with consummate ability, and
drove the unhappy lad to despair.</p>

<p>After dinner the Doctor, instead of rising,
said, laughing—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>‘Henriette, to-night we men will follow the
example of our barbarous brothers of England,
and will remain over our wine after the ladies.
To borrow a habit from your countrymen,
Madame, cannot offend your taste, though I
am afraid I should not find a Frenchwoman
tolerant of it.’</p>

<p>‘I believe Englishmen sit at wine and the
ladies retire,’ said Mademoiselle, hesitating.
She did not like the innovation, and frankly
showed it.</p>

<p>‘Your pardon, Henriette, we have our plans
to discuss. You, Madame, too, will hold us
excused?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, Monsieur, I think it a commendable
custom which keeps men and women so
much apart. They meet then with greater
zest and novelty.’</p>

<p>Dr. Vermont held the door for the ladies and
bowed. He stooped and kissed little Gabrielle,
and held her head a moment against him. And
then when the door closed, he shrugged his
shoulders, and sighed.</p>

<p>‘That’s the Englishwoman for you—a creature
without tact or charm. The British matron
is only fitted to be a mother of a family. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
can neither hold us back, nor encourage us with
dignity. Ah! lucky we are, gentlemen, to be
the slaves and masters of that adorable bundle
of perversities—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la femme française</i>!’</p>

<p>While he spoke he uncorked a bottle of
Monsieur Lenormant’s fine old Burgundy, and
filled each glass to the brim.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons, Messieurs.</i> Let us drink the last
hours away. I give you a toast to begin with—the
delicious Frenchwoman.’</p>

<p>The young men half emptied their glasses at
a draught, and then cast haggard glances at
the sarcastic Doctor. He slowly drained his
glass, and lifted the bottle again.</p>

<p>‘And since our delightful torment would
never consent to go unmated, even in a toast,
let us drink, gentlemen, to her inadequate, but
sympathetic partner—the gallant Frenchman.’</p>

<p>The first bottle of Burgundy loosened their
tongues again, and inspired them to a febrile
gaiety. They laughed loudly, broke into snatches
of song, and by the time the second bottle was
empty, one and all had fallen upon sentimental
reminiscences. They thought themselves back
at Lander’s, and the discretion of the ladies’
retreat could not be questioned. Anatole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
thundered roughly upon the perfidy of a certain
Susanne, and Gaston vowed that none of
her crimes could equal the trick one Blanche
played him—the men used to call her ‘Blanche
of Castille,’ in recognition of the many virtues
she seemed to have inherited from her illustrious
namesakes, doubtless; and Julien interposed
dryly, with a droll anecdote of a lady
once known in Paris as ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Perle Noire</i>’.</p>

<p>Dr. Vermont said nothing, but listened and
attacked the third bottle. He reached across,
and filled Anatole’s glass, and smiled upon him
almost pleasantly.</p>

<p>‘Never mind Susanne, or any other perfidious
fair, my lad. It comes to the same
at the end, whether they have been faithful or
not. They die, and we die, and sleep “a long,
an endless, unawakeable sleep”. It’s half-past
nine now,’ he added, looking at his watch. ‘In
two more hours, we shall be starting out upon
the road that has no ending, leads nowhither,
unless it be to dark, bottomless space.’</p>

<p>‘Why so?’ asked Julien. ‘May we not be
shooting through the stars? Anatole in his
present mood will make straight for Venus,
but I, seeking compensation for the dulness
of a peaceful life, will rather choose Mars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
One ought to fall in for some good fighting
there, eh?’</p>

<p>Anatole stood up, and went over to the
window. The melancholy flow of water from
the drooping eaves could be heard, and the sky
was as black as the river and the landscape.
No light in the heavens, no light below nearer
than Beaufort, no sound but the splash of rain.
The susceptible fellow shivered visibly, and
went back to the table to comfort himself with
another draught of Burgundy.</p>

<p>‘There is not a star to be shot into,’ he said
gloomily; ‘and it is raining as if the whole
universe were melted.’</p>

<p>‘We have a couple more toasts to drink,
gentlemen,’ said the Doctor, standing. ‘Are
your glasses filled?’</p>

<p>Well, if they could do nothing else, they
could at least get drunk before they went on a
voyage among the stars, or fell asleep like dogs
for eternity.</p>

<p>‘An Englishman, when he is tired of life,
takes to drink; a Frenchman blows his brains
out,’ Julien observed, as he helped his neighbour
to the bottle.</p>

<p>‘Upon my conscience, I do not know that
the Englishman has not the best of it.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>‘He is of hardier build, my friend, and can
take his drinking and pessimism in equal doses.
We are the slaves of our nerves, and can stand
neither pessimism nor drink.’</p>

<p>‘Are you ready? The toast is the downfall
of France.’</p>

<p>The young men stolidly laid down their
untasted wine, and looked at the Doctor for
explanation. They themselves might go to
the dogs, and the mischief take them there, or
elsewhere. The universe might melt away
into nothingness, but France, beloved France,
must ever stand fast, proud and honoured and
beautiful. Drink to her downfall? Was
Doctor Vermont mad?</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ said Doctor Vermont imperturbably.
‘We shall be no more. And what
can it matter to us? France has had her day,
as Egypt, Greece, and Rome had theirs. I
would have her spared the misery of a slow
decline. It is now the turn of Russia, which
will be the civilisation of the future. If you
prefer it, we will drink then to Russia.’</p>

<p>So they drank to Russia, long and deeply;
and Anatole, who had a pretty tenor voice,
intoned the Russian Hymn, which the others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
listened to on their feet. And then to keep up
the musical glow, and the golden moment of
unconsciousness, he burst into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>,
knowing well that few can resist that most
thrilling and spirited of national songs.</p>

<p>When he had finished the last verse, and
the last chorus was sung, his companions sat
silently gazing into their empty glasses. They
had finished six bottles of Burgundy between
them, and were now passably drunk, though not
incapable of presenting themselves before the
ladies to say good-bye. The Doctor went
first, and waited for Anatole outside the salon
door.</p>

<p>‘Remember, boy, it is “Good-night”—not
“Good-bye,”’ he said sadly, as he pressed his
friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle and her companion sat before
a low wood fire, chatting quietly. They heard
the songs from the dining-room, and smiled
and shook their heads. Mademoiselle remarked
that the young men were discourteous
enough to carry the habits of the Latin Quarter
into private houses, but since her brother-in-law
tolerated such behaviour, it was not for her to
object, since they were his guests.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>When the door opened, both ladies looked
blankly round at the invasion. The Doctor
stood a moment on the threshold and arched his
brows in smiling signification. The foreigner
felt she would give a good deal to get behind
that smile, and understand that queer lifting
of the eyebrow. That the man wore his smile
as a mask, she had no doubt, and she was
not without suspicion that behind it lay concealed
a different personage from the actor on
view. He advanced, and came and stood in
front of his sister-in-law, looking down on her
with a new gravity on his reckless handsome
face. The flush under his eyes gave a brilliance
to his wistful gaze that justified the fascinated
flutter of the poor lady’s heart. For she had
never seen him look in the least like that,
though she had seen his eyes melt to another.</p>

<p>‘Henriette, good-night,’ he said softly.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, with a glance of
sharp inquiry.</p>

<p>‘Is it good-bye, François?’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye? Why good-bye? It’s a lugubrious
word. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir, ma sœur.</i>’</p>

<p>His lips touched her fingers an instant, and
already he had turned to shake hands with her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
companion. Gaston and Julien came behind
him, and bent their bodies in two in a dignified
salute, but Anatole held out his hand, and clung
feverishly to hers when she took it, while his
eyes held hers in dismayed conjecture. Was it
despair she read in them, or terror, or simply
the pain of young love? But his speech was
lagging and broken, not that, she decided,
of a sober man, and she withdrew her hand
abruptly, with a curt movement of dismissal
of her head.</p>

<p>The boy turned to follow his companions,
and felt his heart break within him as he
went downstairs. While they passed through
the blue-room, the Doctor again leant in affectionate
pressure upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Courage, Anatole. No woman is worth a
pang.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Monsieur le Docteur, you cannot think
that of her. She is worth the best man could
offer, and all he might suffer. You know it,
Doctor. Deny if you admire her.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t deny it, if that will console you.’</p>

<p>‘And you can fling away such a chance,’
moaned Anatole.</p>

<p>‘I fling away nothing, for the simple reason,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
I have nothing to fling away. It is not chance
any of us lack, chances of making fools of
ourselves, of others. Chance, my friend, is
generally another word for blunder. Some
philosophers call the world chance, and is not
that the biggest blunder of all?’</p>

<p>‘You mystify me, Vermont. I call perversity
the worst of all blunders. And is it not perversity,
if you love Mademoiselle Lenormant,
to——’</p>

<p>‘Who says I love Mademoiselle Lenormant?
I loved her sister, in a way, and she is dead.
You’ll find your pistol all ready there on the
bed. Put it into your pocket. It is half-past
eleven. Tell the others I will join them
instantly.’</p>

<p>Before crossing the passage to the other
bedroom, Anatole stole softly upstairs, and
knocked at the salon door. Mademoiselle
Lenormant opened the door, and surveyed
him in disapproving surprise.</p>

<p>‘In what way can I serve you, Monsieur?’
she asked. He slipped into the room under her
arm. There was an empty chair near, and into
it he dropped, glancing up at her prayerfully.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, I am about to face a long,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
perhaps a perilous voyage,’ he said, and the
slight break in his voice and the wet lustre of
his boyish blue eyes captivated her judgment,
and melted her into all heart as she listened
and looked down upon him.</p>

<p>‘I have come back to you, to ask you
before I set out for the unknown, just one
moment, to place your hand on my forehead
and say, “God bless you, Anatole.” Do you
pardon the presumption?’</p>

<p>She bent forward, brushed the tossed hair off
his forehead, kissed it tenderly, and said, ‘God
bless you, Anatole.’</p>

<p>Silently and sobered the four men went out
into the wet night. They walked round the
island first to make sure that every house slept.
There was not a light anywhere, not a sound.
They trod the ground as quietly as booted men
can tread, and came round by the cemetery and
the low broken wall to the tower. Here they
entered, and the Doctor struck a match that
through the blurred illumination they might
see the advantages of the spot he had chosen
to salute the new century. It was certainly
better than the sensation they should create
anywhere near Paris. I doubt not that each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
one privately regretted the rash engagement
they had made over their punch at Lander’s a
week ago. But none had the courage to give
the first voice to regret. False shame and fear
of ridicule held them tongue-tied, and resolved
to make the best of their bargain.</p>

<p>When they had selected a spot near the hollow
of the encroaching rocks, where, if they fell,
they might be washed unnoted down into the
river when the flood came high, Julien separated
himself from the group, and walked over to
the lower wall, whence the lights of Beaufort
could be seen. These lights were rare and dim,
but they cheered him inexpressibly. They were
eloquent of life in the monotony of darkness.</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the wall, and stared
past the shadow of the bridge, out into the
terrible loneliness of night, and shuddered at
the roar of the eddying river below. Upon
the breast of that river one might float into the
beautiful South—a word made up of the sense
of sweetness, and flowers, and sunshine, and
blue waters, and clear skies. When he was a
youngster he used to tell himself that he would
save up his money, and go to Italy. And now
he was no longer young, had not saved up his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
money, had not seen Italy, and was going to
die—and leave it all behind.</p>

<p>At that moment a peal of bells was heard
from over the water, and Gaston Favre announced
in a cold, dull voice that the cathedral
of Beaufort was pealing the midnight chimes.
Had there been light, each man would have
been seen to quiver from head to foot, and then
grow rigid upon his feet.</p>

<p>‘My friends, is it agreed that we salute the
dying century upon the last stroke of the
cathedral bell?’ asked Dr. Vermont, in a
hushed, muffled voice.</p>

<p>‘It is agreed,’ said Gaston, after an imperceptible
pause. The four men gathered together,
and took their pistols out of their
breast-pocket. Dr. Vermont lifted his face
up to the cold wet wind. His lips parted to
the heavens’ moisture, and he felt refreshed.
Since there could be pleasure in the fall of
raindrops upon heated lips, why not even then
admit that life may be worth living? Why
not see the bright background to present pain
as well as the dark contrast of evil behind joy?
We have said the Doctor was a proud and wilful
man, and he would accept no sensation as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
admonishment of error,—but this gave him
some pause.</p>

<p>In one swift backward glance, he saw the
long roll of travelled years—years misspent,
possibly, but not without their baggage of unearned
joys; saw the start of resplendent youth
ringing him onward to a manhood of renown:
remembered friends he had once regarded with
other than mere cynical interest: moments that
had throbbed with light, and all the loveliness
of untainted freshness—perfumed, dewy like a
May orchard in blossom, swathed in youth’s
eternal purple. While the lads around him
faced the inevitable, as they thought, and
though shrinking, white-lipped, and frozen with
horror, from his cold acquiescence, endeavoured
to warm themselves to the last act in the spirit
of bravado and contemplation of the deluged
earth, he had taken a sudden rebound from his
old attitude. It was no longer the dislike of
life and the weariness of experience that held
him in chill imprisonment The old desire for
boyish blisses, and the cordial of laughter
mantled and burst in his brain like a riot of
song. It was a revelation, with all the meaning
of prayer first understood. A pulsing regret
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
for all he was leaving, for what he had known,
and, above all, for that which was yet unknown,
swept him instantly upon a fiery wave. It shot
his arm down nervelessly. The pallid, spiritual
face of Henriette seemed to hang in the sullen
space of black sky and wet black earth. It
glowed like a lamp, and shed a faint illumination
upon the dusk. The faded monotone of
her voice murmured prayerfully above the
weighted splash upon the stones, and awoke
the essential impulse of existence. While such
women lived and prayed for men, could the
deeps of life be said to have closed? ’Tis
an old-fashioned notion, but, like most old-fashioned
things, ’tis the simplest and the best.
It softened the hard retrospection of Dr.
Vermont’s glance, and lent a wavering tenderness
to his peculiar smile.</p>

<p>Upon the sixth stroke of the cathedral bell,
he offered his hand in silence to Julien Renaud,
who squeezed it roughly, in assurance of undiminished
courage. Poor lad! He needed
the assurance sadly. Upon the eighth stroke,
Dr. Vermont sought Gaston’s hand, but the
limp moist fingers he grasped made no effort
to respond to his pressure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>‘Courage, Gaston,’ he cried, in a friendly,
animated voice, and upon the tenth stroke he
turned to Anatole, and had there been a ray
of light above or around, Dr. Vermont’s face
would have been seen to undergo a wonderful
and beautiful change. Honest affection that
makes no pretence of concealment, humanised
it, and a magnanimous resolve filled its expression
with cheering purport. The worst
of us, you see, have our heroic moments, only
it often happens that, like Dr. Vermont’s, they
pass unnoticed in the dark.</p>

<p>‘There is happiness ahead for you yet,
Anatole,’ he breathed quickly through his
teeth, while he swung the unhappy young
fellow’s arm once up and down, in warm emphasis
to communicate the reassuring fluid to
him.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, ’twas an excellent joke, and as
might be expected of such excellent lads as you,
carried out with uncommon spirit and dash. I’m
proud of you, gentlemen, and shall feel honoured
in the privilege of saluting the new century in
your midst. We fire heavenward—a good omen—and
then we shake hands again, in cordial
assent that humanity is not so worn but it may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
still be relied upon for entertainment. You
will say there are higher things. I’m not so
sure there are not. Anyway, ’tis not an excessive
claim that youthful pessimists may
without shame start a fresh century as cheerful
philosophers. The heavens are not always
weeping, and most of us are the better for the
sun’s shining.’</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, and a muffled shout dying
away upon a thick sob, broke from each troubled
breast. The first throb of emotion spent itself
in obedience.</p>

<p>When the last stroke of the cathedral bell
had fallen upon the silence with a prolonged
thin echo, a loud simultaneous report was
heard to startle the night, and travel above
the roar of the river, far across the empty
country.</p>

<p>Gaston and Julien Renaud, utterly unnerved
by the reaction, fell sobbing into each other’s
arms, but Anatole, bewildered past understanding,
thought he was shot, and fell in a
heap at Dr. Vermont’s feet.

<p><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span> suppressed excitement of the past two
days has more than made up for the stillness
of the two months that preceded them. Against
these forty-eight hours of trembling anticipation
and surmise, the long weeks of undisturbed
and pleasant converse and childish chatter make
a background of placid years, instead of weeks.</p>

<p>I see them filled with fireside talks, dips into
musty volumes, walks in a long gallery, to the
murmured music of water, and in frosty starlight,
with the lamps of Beaufort lending cheerfulness
to the scene. Sometimes an expedition
to some castellated town, southward, and wanderings
through vividly coloured streets, or
among lovely hills, where winter flowers grew
and sweetened the air, and the grey of the
river was shot with blue, as it glided into
sunnier regions. And then the friendly greetings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
upon return, and a child’s excited demand
to know what I had seen, how far I had travelled,
perhaps since morning, or the day before; above
all, what I had brought back for her.</p>

<p>Beautiful calm days, already remembered
regretfully as part of the for ever past! They
will outlive, I hope, recent events, though they
have sent them to slumber a while in the cemetery
of the mind. For perturbation fell upon
us, from the hour Mademoiselle and I stood
watching a party of riders bear down toward
us along the great road, like a picture sharply
evoked from the time of postchaise and tragedy
carried upon the momentous clatter of hoofs.</p>

<p>I had met Dr. Vermont, had spoken to him,
and found he did not realise in any way my
expectations. He was a well-bred man, as far
as the superficialities of the drawing-room permitted
me to judge. But his face was inexplicable
and tormenting. It may once have been
a strong face, but its strength was almost effaced
by life. And yet there was no weakness about
it—only an indifference that saps at strength.
It could look daring and reckless, was never
without a smile of quiet irony, and there was
surely enough humorous observation in the mild
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
brown eyes to fill his days with easy pleasure
and interest. But was there not something
worse than sadness behind this good-humoured
mask? I thought so from the first, and my
impression was soon justified by an incredible
episode. I also believed that before the Doctor
had been twenty-four hours in the house, he
had fallen in love with Mademoiselle Lenormant.
But why he should have wanted Anatole
to marry her, I cannot understand. Surely,
surely, he knew that she loved him! must have
known it all along.</p>

<p>When he and his companions left the salon
on that last evening, I said good-night at once
to Mademoiselle. I almost reproached myself
with seeing so much, divining so much that
remained untold. I sat in my room with a
pen in my hand, unable to write from excess
of interest in what was going on around me.
Why should peaceable modern men start off
upon a midnight expedition in this mediæval
fashion? Neither my own imagination could
devise an adequate explanation, nor did I receive
any assistance from the objects that
surrounded me in Monsieur Lenormant’s room,
which I attentively examined. How heavily,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
drearily the rain fell, and what an awful darkness
outside! I stood at the window and
listened to the midnight chimes from the
cathedral and churches of Beaufort. On New
Year’s Eve most people feel sentimental at this
hour, and recall the various places and circumstances
in which they have listened to the peal
of bells upon the death of the old year. But
this I felt to be a sadder occasion than any
other New Year’s Eve, because a whole century
was dying with it, the only century I was familiar
with, and I rather shrank from trial of the new.</p>

<p>An extraordinary sound followed at once
upon the last peal of the bells. It seemed so
close, that it jerked me back from the window,
quite shaken with the reverberation. There
could be no doubt either of its nature or of
the fact that it rose from some near point upon
the island. It was more than a single pistol-shot.
Now, the washerwomen could not have
devised that singular method of saluting the
new-born century. Neither could the chaplain
of the Benedictines, who occupied an old, dark
house at the end of the island upon our side.
The wine-shop of Geraud always closed at nine
o’clock, and on such a wet night no living soul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
would have crossed the bridge for the sake of
his bad liquids.</p>

<p>I went to Mademoiselle’s room, anxious to
hear what opinion she would have upon the
startling occurrence.</p>

<p>‘Somebody has been murdered near us,’ she
cried excitedly, when I entered.</p>

<p>‘Good heavens! what ought we to do?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what we ought to do, but what
I should like to do would be to go and see for
myself,’ she said, and looked questioningly at
me.</p>

<p>‘You are a brave woman, Mademoiselle; I
should have feared to propose it, but I will
gladly accompany you.’</p>

<p>‘Let us go and call up the chaplain of the
Benedictines. He and I are almost the lords
of this island, and if any one were wounded, or
in need of our help, it is our duty to be on the
spot. We will take Joséphine’s big umbrella
and her lantern.’</p>

<p>The rain was awful, and the darkness of the
night was so thick that we seemed to cleave a
way through it as we buffeted with the driving
downpour. To my troubled ear, our steps,
along the deluged pavement, carried a portentous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
message into the silent night. There was
a light in the priest’s house, and the sound of
our footsteps approaching brought him to the
door even before we had knocked.</p>

<p>‘Who is it? What is it?’ he whispered.</p>

<p>‘It is I, Mademoiselle Lenormant, father.
We want you to come and examine the island
with us. There is shooting somewhere, and
somebody may have been murdered or dying.’</p>

<p>‘You have a lamp. Wait a moment, and I
will join you.’ Outside he said, ‘Let us try the
cemetery. Phew! how it rains. It is a deluge.
I am not surprised at your courage, Mademoiselle,
for it is not since yesterday that I
know you. But your friend—ah, I forgot, she
is English, and the Englishwoman, I have
always heard, is capable of anything.’</p>

<p>I doubt not the little compliment of the good
chaplain was as welcome to my friend as to
myself, and warmed us both upon that dreary
adventure. In silence we beat our way round
to the cemetery, and then only remembered,
what we should not have forgotten, that it was
locked. Seeing how unlikely it was that any
one should have contrived to get inside without
the key for any black purpose whatsoever, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
chaplain thought it unnecessary to go back for
it. So we then decided to examine the rocks
along as far as the tower, and afterwards go
over the ruin.</p>

<p>There was nothing about the rocks but an
occasional water-rat, that ran into hiding as
soon as the gleam of the lantern revealed him.
Nothing along the pavement under the low
wall. We bent under the nearest broken arch
of the tower, and entered it upon the river side.
At first our lantern only served to accentuate
the darkness, and show the deeper masses of
shadow in the walls. We groped forward, and
held our breath, in mingled fear and expectation.
Nothing stirred; only the rain fell heavily
with the noise of splashing when it touched the
water below. I advanced foremost, and my
foot brushed something that was not jagged
stone or bramble.</p>

<p>‘Bring your lamp here, Monsieur, whoever
you are,’ a familiar voice cried out, in an imperious
tone.</p>

<p>I started, and stood to let the priest and
Mademoiselle approach, wondering what it could
mean. The priest held the lantern down low,
and we at once recognised Dr. Vermont’s pale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
face looking up from a tangled heap of black
against his knee.</p>

<p>‘We stopped before crossing the bridge to
fire a shot in welcome to the new century, and
this unstrung boy must needs topple off his
balance, and faint away in sheer fright,’ he
hurriedly explained.</p>

<p>‘A very strange proceeding, Monsieur,’ said
the priest, frowning.</p>

<p>I knelt down and touched poor Anatole’s
chill face, but Mademoiselle had no word.
She could only stand and stare in haggard
amazement.</p>

<p>‘I have not asked your opinion, Monsieur.
It is your help I desire,’ said Dr. Vermont,
with an unabated ferocity of pride.</p>

<p>‘Am I not shot?’ asked Anatole vaguely,
opening his eyes and glancing about in terror.</p>

<p>He made an instinctive gesture to feel for
the wound on his forehead, and sat up straight.
He was wild and giddy, and, seeing me first,
could not take his eyes off my face; he even
stretched out his hand in awe to touch me.</p>

<p>‘But for that confounded darkness, we might
have had him in shelter long ago,’ muttered
Dr. Vermont. ‘Julien and Gaston have gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
to look for a lamp. Can you stand, Anatole?’
he asked the bewildered youth.</p>

<p>Anatole stood up quite promptly, without
any assistance. The rain fell from every part
of his form in rills, and, as he shook himself
free, he breathed a deep, happy sigh.</p>

<p>‘Great God! I am saved,’ he murmured, and
staggered forward.</p>

<p>‘Will nobody explain this hideous mystery?’
shouted the chaplain, like ourselves on the
verge of hysterics from emotion.</p>

<p>Dr. Vermont, standing with the lantern in
his hand, shrugged impertinently, and a ray
of light glancing off his pale face, revealed its
enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>‘Take my arm, Henriette,’ he said, very
gently, approaching Mademoiselle, who throughout
the scene was silent. ‘My poor girl,’ I
heard him add, in quite an altered tone, as he
gathered her trembling frame to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" >

<p>At an end for me the quiet studies and the
pleasant talks upon the lovely long terrace of
that old house by the grey river. At an end
for Mademoiselle the waiting; at an end the
long shadow of deferred hope stretched like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
pall upon the backward years. I know not if
the defence of the Emperor Julian has been
concluded. When last I heard from her she
was in Italy with Joséphine, Gabrielle, and
Gabrielle’s strange father. She stands clear
before me in her new home, the snow gathering
early upon her head, and the mark of the
silent, tragic years deepening the austerity that
autumnal joys could never melt from sensitive
lips and shadowed glance. I frame her image
against some old Italian palace in the blackened
arches of its balcony, and see her, when the
stars are out, and regret throbs more poignantly,
gazing across the blue waters that wash her
beloved land, the mirthful, sunlit waters, into
which flows her own grey river.</p>

<p>The old house beyond the broken arches of
the bridge, that leads to the desolate island, has
been sold. Who now sits upon the terrace that
overlooks the towers and spires of Beaufort?
I cherish the hope that it is some one with a
bosom not insusceptible to the thrill of romance,
some one with a heart that still can beat to the
swift measure of fear.</p>

grateful to talk of Henriette Lenormant. He
bore his dismissal bravely, after she had so

and he is generous enough to give thanks for
the cherishing friendship of the woman he loved

<p><span class="smcap">L<b>IKE</b></span> another foreigner, I had my ideal of the
Irishwoman—bewitching, naturally, but built
upon somewhat hackneyed and high-coloured
lines: vivacious play of feature, blue-black hair,
violet eyes, and complexion made up of lilies
and roses. So when Trueberry, the gallantest
friend man ever found on English shores, asked
me to join him in a trip to Erin, imagination
hastily evoked this resplendent creature of
my desire, and I straightway proposed to myself
the pleasing excitement of a flirtatious
romance. I told Trueberry I thought nothing
more delightful than the prospect I had formed,
to fall in love, and ride away. Trueberry, in
his fatal Saxon way, made some grim rejoinder
about the riding away being the pleasantest
part of it.</p>

<p>We shot and rode and fished, and stared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
at the girls, without any fervour of glance or
flutter of pulse, it must be confessed, I alertly
on the look-out for this creature of dazzling
contrasts and laughing provocation. With
fancy still uncomforted, Trueberry was dangerously
hurt, and we were several miles distant
from the nearest village. A peasant offered to
help me carry my comrade down the glen, and
assured me that the lady of the grey manor
would be glad to receive him. Our claim at
the hall was courteously responded to by an old
man-servant, who drew a couch out on which we
stretched my moaning friend, and then I was
directed to the doctor’s house, some way along
the uplands. My guide offered me the shelter
of his roof hard by, when I spoke of looking for
a lodging.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the doctor
and I reached the manor. The sun was level on
the western horizon, an arch of misty gold upon
a broad sheet of silver lying behind the nearer
low-hanging clouds, so that the silver heaven,
beyond this chain of grey and opal hills, looked
mystically remote and clear, while lower down
lake and purple mountains were softened by a
fine white veil of mist, and the sea was visible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
curling its delicate foam upon the crest of the
tide among the rocks. The valley below was
dusk, shut in by the grand sweep of girdling
mountains, and so still was the air that every
far-off sound carried, from the echo of ocean’s
murmuring to the nearer crash of a waterfall hissing
down the rocks, and the pleasant lilt at my
feet of a little rivulet lipping its daisied marge.
The birds were in full chorus, and each of the
dense trees nested song. We left the breezy,
wandering moors, which swept the horizon in a
measurelessness of space as triumphant and
vast seemingly as the illimitable Atlantic rolling
from their base, and took the narrow road that
sloped down to the glen of firs and oak, where
the light could scarce make a path among the
deepening shadows. Outside all was great,
in air, on land, on water. Here intolerable
compression of space and such a diminution of
light as to harass nerves and imagination. My
preoccupation about Trueberry rather stimulated
than blunted my visual faculties, and I
noted with abhorrence each detail of the sharp,
precise landscape; the thin vein of water
glimmering through the darkening grass like a
broken mirror, the abrupt curve of the road from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the shoulder of the bluff, and the stiff, dim
plumes of the heather washed of purple pretension
in the twilight, while through a clump of
black firs the rough front of the manor made a
fainter shade in the grey air. The solitude was
scented with the fragrance of wild thyme, and
as we approached, old-fashioned odours blew
against us from the garden.</p>

<p>Trueberry was restored to a vague consciousness,
and lay with shut eyes in a darkened room.
I walked outside with the doctor, who was a
cheery, hopeful fellow, and in diagnosing my
friend’s case, furnished me with no occasion
for alarm. I found it strange that no member
of the family had come forward to explain the
gracious hospitality by a personal interest in
the wounded man. As I stood in the chill air
musing on this odd unconcern, I heard a light
step behind, coming from the house. I turned,
and faced the woman who was to dominate
my heart by one swift sweep of all that had
ever claimed it.</p>

<p>She looked at me, and in one grave, steadfast
glance the miracle was accomplished. Is this
love? I have been so often, so continuously in
love, and yet have never known anything that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
approached it. It was like the mystery of life
and death—not to be explained, not to be
conquered, not to be eluded. It needs no will
to be born, to die; so it needs no will to
surrender to such an influence. Upon a single
throb of pulse, it has established itself permanently
upon the altar of life, and sentimental
fancies and shabby yearnings drop out of
memory with the sacramental transfusion of soul.</p>

<p>Of course I saw that she was a beautiful
woman, but this only afterwards. What I first
saw was the deep impersonal gaze that drew
the heart from my breast. It met mine with
a full, free beam, and held it upon a wave
of inexplicable emotion. Bondage to it was a
glory, a consecration of my manhood. The
subtle, the elusive nature of my captivation was
the spiritual point upon an ordinary passion.
It was the spurs, the belt of knighthood. For
this I understood to be no mere command of
senses, but the imperative claims of life-long
allegiance, whether for suffering or for
happiness.</p>

<p>Perhaps by nature I was attuned to such
surrender. Since ever romantic hopes first
broke their deeps in my boyish brain, and my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
heart was lifted on the first warm wave of desire,
I have eagerly yearned for free passionate
servitude to one sovereign lady. There was
always the mediæval strain in me, though I
have fluttered idly enough, like the moth round
the flame, and hovered in a sort of protective
sympathy and admiration, round pretty womanhood,
not objecting to being trampled on as a
holocaust to graceful and bewildering caprice.
But now had come the enslavement of the soul,
not of the senses; of the spirit, not of the eye.
Homage did not bend in banter, but was exalted
on the wings of reverence. It was only afterwards
that I remembered the details of the face:
its unchanging pallor and exceeding finish, the
peculiar unrippling sheen of the blonde hair,
like gold leaf in its unshaded polish, the inner
curves of coil as deep an amber as the outer
edges, without shadow of curl or ring round
neck and temple. So smooth and shining a
frame was admirably adjusted to the small,
grave, glacial oval, with its look of wistful
abstracted charm, with a delicate chiselling only
an inspired pencil could copy, with an exquisite
line from brow to chin. Such was the transparency
of the colourless skin that like a shell,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
it seemed in the light to reflect the warm rose
of life beneath. Under the arch of the unerring
brows, long grey eyes, shadowed blackly, that
in girlhood must have presaged storm, but now
the black lay broodingly, a seal to the clear
grey depths. You looked into, not through
them; and found them too bewilderingly unstirred
by the yearning trouble of the gazer.</p>

<p>There was, perhaps, a conscious but not an
undignified expression in her dress. Sweeping
folds of grey matched the austere stillness
of her eyes, as did the full cambric of throat
a wanness reminiscent of a mediæval saint.
Long sleeves lined with silk fell backward, and
the inner ones were of crimped cambric: hardly
affectation, but the supreme touch to beauty so
visibly haloed as hers. Her voice was in keeping
with the clear eloquence of her glance; full,
unperturbed, sustained without conscious modulation
or trick, harmonious like all sounds of
natural sweetness. It fell with the sentence,
as the Irish voice habitually does, but softly,
without abrupt cadences or huskiness.</p>

<p>‘All that lies in our power for your friend’s
care and comfort will be done,’ she said, after
her unhurried survey of me. ‘There is little to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
offer in such an out-of-the-way place but home
medicines and home resources, and there will
not be much in the way of distraction for him,
since I live here alone with my children, and my
solitude is unbroken. I regret that you have
decided to lodge elsewhere, but pray do not
spare us your visits. The house is your friend’s,
and I am honoured in being of use to him.’</p>

<p>It was hardly a bow she made, but drooped
her eyelids with a curious movement, and lowered
her chin from its ineffable upward line. The
words I scarcely heard, though every fibre
trembled with emotion at her speech. I thought
the voice, with the softening syllables dropping
into silence, more exquisite than any music
dreamed of. Its tones accompanied me as a
murmur rather than the remembrance of actual
words in my walk up to the free bluff, whence
I could look down on the grey manor, and
mixed with the resounding roar of ocean, as
the wind blew the melody of the waves shoreward.
What was the distinction of this woman
who through all the days to come offered me
rapture and agony by noontide and by midnight?
Not her beauty so much as her essential difference
from others. Not the gleaming gold of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
her hair, but the solemn simplicity of her bearing
in such accord with the vast and unbroken
solitude around her. Her voice I acknowledged
without shrinking or terror, as we accept all
essential elements, to be henceforth the dominant
key of life for me, the note to sound my
depths and touch me at will as an impassive
instrument. Was this woman free? I asked
myself, with a thrill of revolt, as I remembered
her mention of children. But no word of
husband! This fact let in a ray of hope upon
my dread. I could never again belong to
myself with the cheap security of an hour ago,
and what was there for me if there was no room
for me in the chambers of her heart?</p>

<p>At the cottage I found my host frying some
salmon for supper. He was a tall, bent peasant,
meagre and pallid from much thinking and
under-feeding, with all the Celt’s quaint mixture
of melancholy and humour in his keen blue
eyes and wrinkled smile. He did the honours
of his humble dwelling with stately courtesy,
and was too proud and well-bred to offer futile
apologies for the poverty of his shepherd fare
and rude bed.</p>

<p>‘Your friend, sir, is not anything worse, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
trust,’ he said. I gave him the doctor’s report,
and said it was now a case for complete rest
and care. I reddened with remorse, remembering
how little I had been thinking of Trueberry.</p>

<p>‘Ah, ’tis he that’s in excellent hands,’ said
the peasant, turning the salmon, and then
dreamily rested his cheek against the closed
hand that held the fork, with his elbow supported
on the other wrist.</p>

<p>‘May I not learn to whom we are indebted
for so much kindness?’ I asked tremulously.</p>

<p>‘Your friend, sir, is at the house of Lady
Brases Fitzowen,’ he answered, and I shrank
beneath the sharp look he cast on me. ‘’Tis
herself, sure, we all love and delight in as if
she was one of God’s angels.’</p>

<p>This seemed to me in my exalted mood as
such an obvious statement that I received it
with the same simplicity it had been uttered.
Were we not brother Celts,—albeit, I a
Parisianised Breton, and he an illiterate
native of wild Kerry uplands? His tribute to
the lady of my destiny raced a flame through
me like a delicious flattery.</p>

<p>‘I have seen her,’ I said, striving to command
my voice in unconfessing tones. ‘I can quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
believe you. I should like to know something
of her, if you will not deem my curiosity an
impertinence. She spoke of her children. Does
her husband live?’</p>

<p>‘He does,’ the peasant answered, I thought
sullenly.</p>

<p>I caught a fork fiercely in my hand, and bent
to trace figures with it on the cloth, hoping
thereby to shield my excessive pain from his
sharp scrutiny.</p>

<p>‘She did not mention him to me,’ I half
cried.</p>

<p>‘’Tis natural. They’re no longer one.’</p>

<p>Oh, the warm revulsion, the wild joy in that
queer reply. I read in it the peasant’s definition
of divorce. It sprang light and flame through
me, and heated senses benumbed a moment
ago. It gave definiteness to rash hope, and
melted away all doubt and apprehension.
Brases free was to be wooed. Heaven knows
conceit was never more eliminated from self-judgment
than then, but I felt the urgent claim
of the rare passion so instantaneously born.
All my worth lay in the quality of that love,
and it was not such that any woman could reject
without a pang.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>‘Then she is free,’ I said, and heard the thrill
in my own voice.</p>

<p>‘Free!’ exclaimed the peasant, frowning.
‘That’s as may be. Them Protestants believe
such-like things, but we don’t, sir. However
things happen, we hold folk once married can
only be freed by death. I take it, sir, you come
from foreign parts, though ’tis a wonder to me
how you have learnt the English tongue so well.
May be, beyond in your land, they’re like the
Protestants, and play fast and loose with the
marriage tie.’</p>

<p>He laid the dish of salmon on the table,
and disappeared outside. My state of mixed
emotions, of exasperated nerves, of pulses
throbbing against my consciousness like a discordant
instrument, anger with that prejudiced
peasant predominating, reduced me to the level
of savage and child. The fellow in his implied
abhorrence of divorce was so aggravatingly
phlegmatic, so heartlessly unconscious of all it
might mean for me. I did not knock him down
or force him to eat his obnoxious words, but
sat still and endeavoured not to observe the
rest of his rational preparations for the evening
meal. I was on fire for further facts of the tale,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
but dared not question, in my uncontrollable
temper. When the peasant at length seated
himself opposite me, with a dish of salmon,
smoking potatoes, and a bottle of potheen between
us, I was able to make a fair pretence of
hunger. I had no difficulty in praising the
salmon and the big flowery potatoes, the best of
the world, and novelty supplied the needful
sauce. The potheen was simply barbarous, a
suitable drink for Caliban or the Indian brave,
and no amount of water could soothe it to my
French palate. But between lively grimaces
over it, I was enabled to ask, without self-betrayal—</p>

<p>‘Then, I suppose, Lady Fitzowen’s husband
does not live at the manor?’</p>

<p>He looked at me gravely over his glass, and
nodded.</p>

<p>‘They are divorced?’</p>

<p>‘Not quite as I should say. Separated, they
call it.’</p>

<p>Here was a toppling down of the airiest edifice
built of gossamer. I could have cried out at
the stab like any thwarted child. And yet the
barrier of a living husband, like an unclean
skeleton, between us, made that vision in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
early twilight no less pure and spiritual than
when not seen across the tragic story, <i>married
widowhood</i>. A widow, still had sanctity lain
upon my suit, where now reproach would lie as
a pall. Suppose my love drew hers, how should
I live through terror of waking some poisonous
snake to her mortal injury, of the nameless
dread of slander to breathe its dark flame
against her sinless brow? A shadow upon such
devotion as mine was an unacceptable desecration.
Torture itself prompted me to further
questioning.</p>

<p>‘Was it she who sought separation?’</p>

<p>‘I believe it was her people, sir. He was a
bad lot, they say, wild after the women, and not
over nice in his ways. She’s gentle now, but
she was proud and passionate as a girl, and she
felt the shame of the thing and ran. ’Tis a
wonder the poor crathurs don’t oftener run, the
provocation thim fine gentlemen gives them.
Anyway, her people settled the matter, and she
came to live here, ’tis now close on four years
ago. The second child was born here, God
bless it, and we all love it like our own.’</p>

<p>I went outside to smoke a cigarette in the
solitude of starlit night. One never wants for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
proof of how much cruelty, shame, misery, and
injustice may be gathered into an innocent girl’s
existence by marriage. I had already seen
much of it, and was familiar with the musings
melancholy contemplation of it provoked. But
here was matter not for musing but for fiery
revolt. Every nerve thrilled with a sympathy
so complete as to make her retrospective pain
most personally mine, to thrust my individuality
from its old bright environment out for ever into
her desperate loneliness. Joy seemed to me a
miserable mockery, the portion of trivial, contemptible
humanity. The best proof of moral
worth lay in the excess of suffering endured.
Virtue was measured by the degree of pain, and
laughter dwelt with the ignoble jesters and
clowns. Sorrow was a diadem upon that golden
head, I murmured, and looked for confirmation
in the cold radiance of the stars above, darting
their shuttles of lambent flame in and out the
purple depths of sky.</p>

<p>I peered down through the darkness, searching
for the grey manor among the massive
shadows. But no lighted window revealed it to
my yearning gaze, and somehow I felt glad that
Brases had suffered. Tears were the mark of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the elect, and had given her eyes that penetrating,
unjoyous clearness of the stars, had given
her beautiful lips their set line of austere silence,
had placed on that frail white brow the conquering
seal of valour and forbearance. A
passion so remote from whimpering sentiment
as that which she had inspired, was one to take
pride in, and I cared not now whether grief or
weal were my portion, for I, too, was crowned,
and, like her, stood apart.</p>

<p>I was glad to face the wide, empty moors by
sunrise. The valley lay below the brilliantly lit
mountain shoulder, where scarcely a shadow
offered rest for the eyes. The Reeks opening
out, peak upon peak, glittering and wild, made
a magnificent picture. Here a crescent of
shattered points, there a sunny tarn through
the hollow of the cliff, shot with amber rays;
and downward, deep valley beyond deep valley,
dusk with foliage, and broken by zigzag pathways.
I sat on the shelf of a rock, whence I
could perceive the glen and grey mass of
the manor. An eagle sweeping over the brow
of the bluff, the shrill cry of curlews in their
undulary shoreward flight, presaging tempest,
the thunder of the Atlantic in the steady roll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of its surges, were the sole sounds in my
majestic solitude.</p>

<p>I sat and dreamed, and filled in the unknown
pages of that one volume now for me, the life
of an innocent and high-spirited girl, urged in
the passivity of an untroubled heart into an
uncongenial marriage. The thought that she
might have loved a worthless husband was an
intolerable smart, and I rejected it for the more
bearable belief that she had entered bondage in
a neutral condition, without any apprehension
of the warmer moments of life, unawakened to
the imperious claims of the heart.</p>

<p>And in dwelling bitterly on the penalties of
such experience, the illimitable price exacted for
limitable error, I started to my feet in angry
denial that part of the price was the harsh
sentence against other choice. What did it
matter if the world’s wisdom rebuked our folly?
What did it matter if the callous eye saw stain
where I felt glory? What did anything matter,
so long as I had the will to leap all barriers
that lay between Brases and me? To pass
through flame and wave, so that she was on
the other side of peril with outstretched
arms?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>The manor, with its air of rude decay, was
curious rather than picturesque. It fronted a
lawn that dropped into a thick plantation of
fir, along which ran a silver trout-stream. The
gravelled walks wandered away into the woodlands
that waved in brilliant arches of beech
and larch by an upward slope to the horizon,
where the spires of pine scalloped the skyline.
Trueberry was asleep, so I amused myself by
inspecting the portraits of the hall. They were
all members of my hostess’s family. That was
obvious, even if the old butler had not informed
me of the fact. A fair lady in velvet and long
ruffles looked at me with her clear eyes, just so
sweet, but bolder, and one tall girl was so
vividly like her that I greeted her with a flame
of enamoured recognition I would not dare
bestow on the living woman. The same gold-leaf
of hair, the same exquisite intangibility of
look, the same wanness of cheek and ineffable
upward line of chin and brow.</p>

<p>When at last I saw Trueberry, I found him
coherent and eager for my visit. He lay in a
faded, heavily-curtained room, so old and dim
that the bright rays of morning penetrating
through the crimson curtains sparkled incongruously,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
and turned squares of the silk into
blood-red. Coming in from the sunlit air, its
sombreness shot me blind, and I could see nothing
until I had blinked the sun out of my eyes.</p>

<p>‘What a dark room!’ I cried.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s a delightful room,’ said Trueberry
dreamily, with the look of a visionary. ‘I’m so
glad I had that accident, and was carried in
here. Visions seem to start out of half-forgotten
romances, and everything is suggestive. It’s so
dark and quaint and big. Just the room to be
ill in, and not mope. I like my condition, too,
now that pain is on the wane. Fact and fancy
are so deliciously inextricable. I never know
what is really happening and what I am imagining.
Last night I saw a picture that seemed
to be real, and was in perfect harmony with the
antique air of the room. A sort of Saint Elizabeth
in a mediæval frame. You know one’s
ideal of St Elizabeth?’ he added, looking at me
with a little quizzical stir in his languid glance.
‘Sweet, serious, and lovely, carrying roses from
heaven, and smiling softly on children and the
sick. She smiled at me when she saw me staring.’</p>

<p>‘Your hostess?’ I asked, chill with apprehension.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>‘I suppose so, if it wasn’t a dream. There’s
fever in my blood still, and at night the imagination
is a terrible agent. Yet the picture
remains so distinct upon memory: the voice
was so real, so musical, I can hear it still.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me about it,’ I said, curious and
alarmed.</p>

<p>‘I was trying to make out my surroundings
in the dull lamplight, and wondering where you
were, when a curtain was lifted by the whitest
hand I have ever seen, and framed in the folds
was a beautiful pale woman in grey. She held
a lamp high up, and the light caught and
played over her brilliant hair till it shone like
living gold. I feared to wink lest the vision
should vanish. The light revealed the bust,
while the folds of the skirt fell into heavy shadow.
It was the crimped white about neck and wrists
and the long queer sleeves that made me imagine
fever had evoked some recollection of
Italian galleries—half Giotto, half Botticelli:
but she actually moved, and the unfathomable
gravity of her gaze held mine, and when she
smiled, I ceased to feel pain.’</p>

<p>He spoke almost to himself, as if he had forgotten
my presence, and as I looked down at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
him, so drowsily contented, I saw the old tragic
monster lifting its terrible head between us.
For the first time I was conscious of a jealous
pang in contemplation of his favour of person.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grands dieux!</i> and I so fatally ugly! And if
Trueberry had possessed nothing but good
looks, I had my brains and my reputation
to balance that advantage. But he was no
mere hero of sentimental girlhood—he was a
handsome, high-bred gentleman, with all the
finest qualities to repay a noble woman’s love,
with all the personal charm to captivate a
fastidious woman’s fancy. What had won my
admiring friendship might be trusted to win
Brases’ responsive love:—his sincerity, a certain
picturesque dash that always made me think of
Buckingham as described by Dumas—Anne of
Austria’s Buckingham. It breathed so essentially
the high air of romance, the chivalry, the
ennobling sentimentality of vigorous manhood.
He was no troubadour, but as I have said,
Buckingham to the heels in modern raiment,
unflinching before peril, of delightful
manners, faithful to friend, implacable to foe,
brilliant, generous, and full of romantic spirit.
Such a woman as Brases I deemed above susceptibility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
to a mere facile charm of manner,
averse from so vulgar a quality as fascination.
But Trueberry did not fascinate: he captivated.
He carried sunshine with him to appeal to the
austerest temperament, and in some subtle way,
without an effort, became a need. A more
attractive manliness was nowhere to be met,
and if in friendship I found him indispensable,
what would he not be to the woman whose
heart he won?</p>

<p>Should I repeat the peasant’s talk? Better
not. Silence between us was best until speech
could not be avoided. So I took an aching
heart back to the cottage, with a promise to
return in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="BRASES_II">II</h3>
</div>

<p>That afternoon, passing through the hall on
my way to Trueberry’s room, I was arrested
upon no direct effort of will by the face of the
pale blonde girl, looking at me so vividly out
of canvas through the dear glance my own
ached with longing to behold. Standing thus,
my ear detected with a thrill of recognition the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
light footfall behind me. I turned, and the
sight was water to a man fevered with thirst.
All morning I had wondered if a transient
state of nerves might not be accountable for an
effect perhaps over-excited imagination had
exaggerated. But this second meeting was full
confirmation of the agonising power of Brases
over me. I rejoiced in this added proof of my
servitude. Because of her presence, life revealed
deeper meaning, earth fresher hues. My heart
fluttered on the topmost crest of emotion, and
tossed on a violent wave of joy. The awful
quietude of our full long gaze held me tranced
in silence.</p>

<p>‘You found your friend better,’ she said,
and her voice in that tense moment was like
the bursting of the surges upon their swell.
My eyes must have told it with fatal illumination,
had hers not absently fallen on a portrait.
‘I should gladly press you to stay here with
him, but I fear you would find it dull. The
house, I know, is gloomy, and I see no one.
But if you can face the dulness for your friend’s
sake, if it would lessen your anxiety——’</p>

<p>‘You are too kind,’ I burst out eagerly, for
some inexplicable reason repelled by the suggestion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of Trueberry and myself together
under her roof. ‘My friend is in the best of
hands, and I should not dream of trespassing
so far. Besides, I enjoy my walks to and from
the cottage.’</p>

<p>What an idiot I was, to be sure, and what a
miserably inadequate refusal! Yet could I give
my real reason? That a sharp-witted man of
the world, an intelligent French writer of some
fame, should be driven to inane stuttering at
the greatest moment of his existence, was
surely a grotesque fatality. I saw with a shock
the contraction of the delicate brows, and the
surprised interrogation of the proud glance she
levelled at me. Then pride and surprise ebbed
back to their still depths, and the brows
smoothed by sheer effort of will, I divined,
and she smiled coldly, a little austere smile,
remote and frosted like a ray on ice. A
woman of my own land would have read below
the commonplace words the deeper melody of
the heart’s unuttered eloquence. But Brases, so
untutored, so wrapped in her musing and undiscerning
solitude, had not this tact of sympathy,
this subtle divination, this keen scent of sex.
Her simplicity was mournful and gentle, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
not penetrative nor scrutinising. Mute fervour
I saw would leave her untroubled, and with
Trueberry near, I feared to hope her regard
would ever gleam and drop in glad surrender
at my coming, or her pulses quicken to the
bidding of my touch. I felt crushed, out of
reach of comfort, and resolved no more to
tread that haunting pathway from the little
rocky plateau to this sombre valley, but to
go out with my immeasurable pain into the
soothing limitlessness of earth and sea and air
upon the moors. Yet there was the misery of
it—I could not command my will. I felt
the folly of it; I apprehended the misery of
a rivalry between Trueberry and me,—self at
odds with the finest friendship that ever knitted
men together. But I as well knew that my
hunger to-morrow for Brases would be greater
even than to-day, and a starving man will gnaw
at straw when you refuse him bread.</p>

<p>I found Trueberry half raised upon his
pillow, a pink flush like the reflection of a
flame upon his pallid cheek, and the blue of his
eyes burning darkly.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen her?’ he asked, meeting my
hand affectionately.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>The dull, brief tone must have struck him as
implied negation of his visible enthusiasm, for
he scanned my face quickly, and asked in a
surprised voice—</p>

<p>‘Don’t you find her beautiful, Gontran?’</p>

<p>‘Most beautiful,’ I replied, with grim emphasis.</p>

<p>I sat down, and took up a volume of <i>The
Ring and the Book</i>, which lay on a little table
close to an arm-chair at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>‘No, no, Gontran. Not that, pray. She has
been reading it to me,’ he shouted, as if a
wound were pressed.</p>

<p>I looked at him queerly, I felt; how far he
had travelled already, when it was ‘she’ with
him, and he could voice so candidly the trouble
of blood and being. Or else my passion was
the deeper, and ran in a mysterious channel,
where speech is desecration, thought hardly
delicate enough to follow its intangible flow.</p>

<p>‘You remember those lovely lines, beginning—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“First infancy pellucid as a pearl”?</p>
</div>

<p>‘They might have been written of her,’ he
continued, in his dear, fresh, expansive way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
‘Pompilia, infant, child, maid, woman, wife, the
ideal of our earth. Why, it was surely of her
that Browning was dreaming.’</p>

<p>I continued in silence to finger the book her
hand had touched, and my eye fell on that
chivalrous passage, clear even to my foreign eye
in spite of antipathy to Browning’s roughness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘And if they recognised in a critical flash</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sully Prudhomme, I thought, would have
expressed the idea more exquisitely. I preferred
the soft musical murmur of that unapproachable
little poem, the breathing soul
of a tenderer chivalry:</p>

<p>But the virile sweep of the sentiment Browning
revealed had something of ocean’s strength and
immensity that aroused the sea-born Breton
under the extraneous veneer of culture. A
Parisian cannot escape the charm of classic
polish, but now and then with us the Celt runs
riot, and sentiment rebels against the leash of
form.</p>

<p>Under the cynicism of the analytical novelist’s
sacrifice, renunciation, the conquering strife of
passion over duty, noble failure, the greatly
borne martyrdom of humanity, are the things
that have ever appealed to me. I have always
desired to love and be loved in the cleansing
fire of pain rather than in the facile yielding to
the senses. So that there really was no logical
reason why I should whimper and mope because
Brases had not dropped into my arms
by some magnetic influence. And even if she
chose elsewhere! So long as her choice was
justified by happiness, what need had I to complain?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
I murmured Sully Prudhomme’s lines,
of a more subtle beauty of feeling than Browning’s,
and Trueberry cocked a wistful brow.</p>

<p>‘Repeat them louder, they sound so beautiful,’
he urged, and I repeated them.</p>

</div>

<p>he cried, with water in his eyes. ‘Could you picture
yourself, Gontran, saying that of the woman
you loved to the man who had gained her!’</p>

<p>‘I hope so,’ I replied, smiling. ‘The bitter
would be so sweet. And then the magnificent
retort upon broken hopes:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I spoke lightly, like the cynical boulevardier,
while inwardly I was bleeding. But Trueberry,
bereft, by weakness and love, of all power of
scrutiny or penetration, saw nothing of my
suffering. He was in the absorbing paradise
of a new-born claim, in the unconscious premonition
of response, and smiled vaguely at
me, dear fellow, as if a strong but agreeable
opiate had drugged him.</p>

<p>Trueberry was so improved next morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
that I found the children playing in his room.
They were a little lad and girl in the toddling
age, prettily named Brendan and Mave. I
have never seen children so well-bred, so charming
to look at and to talk to. The boy had
thick brown curls, with a reddish gleam in
them, and his mother’s eyes, while the girl
had her gold hair, with big eyes, like the leaf
of a purple pansy. They lisped, as only angels
ought to lisp, and fetched your heart between
your eyelashes from very delight and sympathy.</p>

<p>While we played and chattered, and those
pretty creatures rolled over Trueberry, the
waves of their embroidered skirts entangled
in his beard and neck, they like white balls,
taking their falls so good-humouredly, and
then on the ground, standing like birds to
shake out their snowy plumage, the door
opened, and Brases smiled upon the threshold.</p>

<p>Trueberry’s pinched expressive face waved
pink, and gazing blue went instantly to black.
I stood grasping the back of my chair, and saw
Brases for the first time not icily aloof, not
throned on dead dreams. There was a human
flame under her pallor, and her smile had an
approachable womanly sweetness. It deepened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the grey of her eyes, and lent an ineffable softness
to her sad mouth. The curves of the lips
pleaded like a child’s for tenderness and unexacting
devotion. I could have bent a knee
to her in a rush of feeling less lofty than homage,
and said: ‘Bid me suffer, dear one, so that
you are happy.’ To my surprise, she shook
hands with me, in cordial frankness, hoped I
was pleased with the condition of my friend,
and then bent and took Trueberry’s hand with
a very different air. Of course, he was her invalid,
and no woman worth the name is ever
the same to the sick and the strong. For
Brases to look at me like that, and hold my
hand with that gentle imperiousness, I, too,
should have to be wounded and stretched
under her roof on my back.</p>

<p>She had no Irish fluency, and her speech was
curiously strained and elaborated, without, however,
any obvious affectation. The words came
deliberately, and yet with a fearless reticence.
It was repression, not secrecy. Life with her
was a tale of baffled personal hopes, of unmeasured
pain, of nature overcome, of lower
impulses proudly unrecognised, of cold allegiance
to duty, and the unfathomable tenderness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
of maternity. Her children, as she told us, with
their little arms about her neck, were her one
joy.</p>

<p>‘I fear I spoil them,’ she added; ‘but I strive
to make them think of others, while they, alas!
so well know that I only think of them.’</p>

<p>Mave, I was glad to see, was the mother’s
favourite. At all times I like a woman to love
her girls best; the preference breathes in my
esteem, so essentially of distinction and lovableness.
But æsthetic gratification here was sharpened
by the fact that Mave’s father had never
seen her. To me Mave was all her mother’s
child, for which reason, during my visits, I
never failed to coax her on my knee, where
she would sit at first in a stiffened attitude of
good behaviour, until she got used to my dark,
foreign face, and gleefully ran to greet me.
While she nestled and gurgled in my arms, lisping
her excited speech, Trueberry and Brendan
chanted nursery rhymes, taught each other
surprising verses, and told one another fairy tales.</p>

<p>It was the day Trueberry first got up that
conjecture stabbed me with the jealous knife
of certainty. Despair closed round me like a
physical grasp, and I toppled rudely over my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
airy ideal of renunciation and self-effacement.
I had dwelt with such soothing vanity of spirit
on my gracious bending to the happiness of
my sovereign lady and my friend, and when
I saw them then exchange a long, grave, shining
gaze of full confession, and noted the enchanting
air of command with which she waved him
back to his chair, when he stood to greet her,
the deeps of nature burst their barriers.</p>

<p>Unstrung and irritable from the strain of
my false position, I walked rapidly up to the
cottage, asking myself whether I should go or
stay, and unable to decide which would cost
me more. My host was smoking a pipe outside,
in placid contemplation of a patch of potatoes.
He directed secretive eyeshot sideways on me
in sharp inquiry, then bent his glance again
upon the green leaves, and meditatively kicked
away a stone.</p>

<p>‘’Tisn’t good for a young man of your years,
sir, to lead this sort of life,’ he said. ‘Foreign
cities are gay places, I’ve heard tell. ’Tis
among them you ought to be. The moors,
and the rocks, and the sea, the praties I plant
and eat, and the salmon I catch, satisfy the likes
of me, but I’m thinking, sir, ’tis poor work for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
you, counting the stars be night, and crying
for the moon be day.’</p>

<p>‘A man might be worse employed than
watching the stars,’ I replied, ignoring his
rebuke.</p>

<p>‘To be sure, sir. ’Tis a candle-light that
teaches us a wonderful power of patience.
When you look at them, the wear and tear of
life seems a useless sort of thing.’</p>

<p>‘So it seems, viewed in any light—rush, or
gas, or sun,’ I assented drearily. ‘But why do you
want to get rid of me, if I am content to stay?’</p>

<p>‘I’d be grieved to think you imagined me
anything but proud of your company, sir;
but I’m thinking it ’ud be best for yourself
to go away. You look down a bit lately, and
’tis me own heart bleeds for you. But you’re
young, agra, and them sort of troubles soon
pass. ’Tis surprising how wonderful quick the
heart is to mend any time.’</p>

<p>His intention and sympathy sprang tears to
my eyes. He saw this, and touched my shoulder
gently, nodding a sapient head.</p>

<p>‘I make bold to tell you, sir, that a fine
pleasant boy like yourself has no business to go
hankering after one as has known deception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and wept misfortune, an’ whose husband lives.
Them’s foreign ways, I know. Haven’t I read
a power of books? Take my word for it, ’tis
better to run after the girls. There it’s all fair
and square, above board, and ’tis natural. ’Tis
your duty to her and yourself to turn your
back on us.’</p>

<p>‘It always is our duty to be most miserable,
I fear,’ I said dejectedly. ‘But why should a
woman wear weeds because a scoundrel lives?
in the bloom of youth, beautiful, with a maiden
heart for the winning? and what law is broken
by honourable devotion?’</p>

<p>I forgot I was talking to a peasant, and stood
there in the sunlight, pleading Trueberry’s
cause. For what now had I to do with her
heart, or she with my love? My hour of ordeal
had come, and I confess I was surprised by my
own frailty. I had expected to bear it so much
better, to act so much more gallant a part.
Instead, I was broken with jealousy, and my
eyes were blinded with tears. I had not
conquered nature, did not swim triumphantly
in the upper sphere of impersonal feeling, submissive
to an ideal sway, glorying in the
supreme servitude of unacknowledged, unexacting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
devotion. I was a poor exasperated human
wretch, unjustly angry with my friend for his
selfish blindness, wrath with the woman’s
serenity, which could not interpret my feeling,
vexed that neither, in their bliss, should care
whether I lived or died of it. I had craved so
little,—the pale ray of hope, insubstantial as a
dream, but cherished with frenzy. And now
how was I to still the fierce ache of regret in
the years ahead? Bereavement fronted me, a
silent spectre, my mate for evermore. The
precious hours had gone, sleepless nights and
sullen days, in a hinted persistence of prayer in
her presence, of longing out of it, and nothing to
come of all the anguish, of revolving transport
and agony, but this sense of miserable failure.</p>

<p>Looking down from the plateau to the glen,
it seemed to me that I had been accomplishing
this backward and forward march from cottage
to manor by an unreal measurement of time.
The years before sank into insignificance beside
these two weeks of frustrated yearning. I went
into the house to shut my grief away from the
friendly scrutiny of my peasant friend, and
battled with the monster that wrecks our dignity
and our intelligence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="BRASES_III">III</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning, with seared eyelids, and heart
a red raw wound, conscious of the peasant’s
disapproving inspection, my feet carried me
unreluctantly toward torture. It was part of my
implacable fate that I should diagnose my own
misery through the happiness of the two beings
who bounded the limits of sensation for me.
Trueberry was alone, and greeted me with a
vagueness of glance that denoted retrospective
bliss. He was glad to see me in a quiet way,
as a feature in enchanting environment.</p>

<p>We smoked in silence until our incommunicative
companionship was abruptly disturbed by
the arrival of a couple of officers from a neighbouring
garrison town. Pleasant fellows both,
carrying a rollicking breath of Lever into the
surcharged atmosphere. They spoke at the top
of their voices, hailed us with obvious delight,
joked, quizzed, and gallantly misconducted
themselves from the point of view of lucky and
unlucky lover. I was reminded that I was
French, and made an effort to do honour to my
land. While they stayed, I shook off melancholy,
and matched their breezy recklessness with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
intoxication of despair. Heaven knows what
we laughed at, but everybody except Trueberry
shouted hearty guffaws, and seemed to regard
life as the most entertaining of jokes. They
chaffed Trueberry on his captivity to isolated
beauty, and hinted in their broad barrack way
at the perils of bewitchment. Trueberry went
white with repressed anger, and I dusky as a
savage. I wanted to fell the harmless fool for a
pleasantry common enough in affairs of gallantry
between men, but Trueberry passed it off with
his superlative breeding, and the officer adroitly
changed the conversation.</p>

<p>When Brases joined us before lunch, the
younger of the two again provoked me by
approaching her with a slight military swagger,
his air, as he took her beautiful hand, so clearly
saying: ‘Madame, allow me to observe that
you are a remarkably handsome woman, and
I shouldn’t mind being your captive myself.’
Not that he was impertinent or fatuous, but his
admiration was of a crude and youthful and
self-assured flavour. Trueberry lifted a dolorous
lid upon me, as if seeking sympathy in me for
the exquisite torment of this outer desecrating
breath upon the divine and hidden.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>They left us as cheerily as they had come,
bidding me persuade Lady Fitzowen to come
to their garrison ball next week. The major
begged to know what sins the county had
committed, to be so punished by its fairest
woman. I saw Trueberry’s fingers clench
ominously, and my own lips shut upon a grim
twist for all response. Brases stared at them
softly, as if they were a long way off, and then
a little puzzled smile stirred her eyes as she
sought Trueberry’s glance.</p>

<p>‘I wish you could persuade Monsieur d’Harcourt
to go,’ was her acknowledgment of their
invitation. ‘He does not look nearly so well
as when he first came.’</p>

<p>I grasped this notice as a famished dog
pounces on a stale crust. I flung her an
enchanted beam of gratitude, and red ran
momently through the grey universe. She came
out, and stood beside me on the broad gravel,
when the officers had driven away, and I found
courage to urge her to come with me to the ball
at Kilstern. It was no baseness to my friend,
surely, that I should hunger and thirst and pray
for one little moment of her life unshared with
him!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>‘Had I any such foolish desire, Monsieur, my
obligations as hostess would still prevent me.
It is so little I can do for your friend, so
much I would gladly do. But it is no privation
for me to dispense with society. I never
liked it, and have only bitter recollections of it.
I ask nothing now from life but peace,—and
strength to live my days for my children’s sake,
striving not to wish them shortened, and
remembering that there is much else besides
personal hope and happiness. One despairs so
quickly in youth, and then the children come,
with their sweet faces made up of morning
light, soft as flowers, with the smile of paradise
in their clear eyes. And youth for me lies so
far away,’ she added, with a scarce perceptible
change of voice, and a ray lighting up her
delicate face, showed a smile so wan and faint
as rather to resemble the memory of a smile,
reminiscent as the spectre of that youth she
greeted as an alien, and I listening, wished I
had died before hearing words so sad from her
lips.</p>

<p>Her gesture in one less superlatively sincere
might have been taxed with coquetry, so exquisite
was its expression; her white hands fell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in a gentle depression with the finger-tips
curved inward.</p>

<p>‘Even music no longer pleases me,’ she continued,
sweeping the circumscribed scene with
a flame of revolt under the drawn arch of the
lovely brows. ‘It is not sad enough. That is
why I am so fond of the ravening melancholy
of ocean’s song down upon the desolate
beach. I listen for it at night as I lie awake,
and it is the eternal funeral march of my dead
youth.’</p>

<p>It was hardly by an effort of will that she
ceased speaking: speech dropped from her as
sound drops from the receding wave, and I
could have cried aloud in passionate protest as
I saw the veil drawn over this transient revelation
of herself. Never had she spoken to me so
before. Never had she referred to her past.
And the hint that all joy for her lay in her
children fired my brain with hope’s delirium.
Surely I had been mistaken in my haunting
dread, and stupidly interpreted the looks
between her and Trueberry. He might love
her, as I loved her, but her feeling was only the
soft interest of compassion. And yet—and
yet——!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Leaving her, I walked slowly down the path.
At the gate I looked back. She was still
standing there, staring across the hills, with the
sunset hues upon the amber of her head, and
revealing the matchless purity of line and tint
of face and throat. Not surrender, not love,
did that dejection of air denote. The thought
went with me, rooted in my heart, and kept
me awake, tossing on a fever-troubled pillow.
I started up, and stood at the window to watch
the stars till dawn sent a grey glimmer down
the dusk, and a white cloud sped like a wing
over the sky. I had a foreboding of rashness,
of perilous explosion on the morrow, unless I
had the wisdom to steal out alone into the
empty world. If they loved one another, it
was plainly my duty. But, oh! to be able to
look into her eyes, and cry: ‘I love you, yet I
leave you. For me death were easier, but my
death would stain your bliss with regret’s
shadow.’</p>

<p>I questioned the stars in my blind anguish to
learn if there were no resources in nature to wall
in this terrible blank of being that stretched so
miserably, so limitlessly before me as a future
without Brases or Trueberry. Old interests, old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
tastes, old desires had dropped from me, and I
stood beggared of sum and aim of life.’</p>

<p>I was abroad upon the moors by sunrise,
lessening my feeling of personal diminution in
the earth’s grandeur and the wavering immensity
of the Atlantic as it rolled under the lemon-tinted
horizon. I took my last look of forked
mountains against the grey-shot blue of the
heaven, of shattered rocks, and sombre tarn
seen through the opening of a valley, and the
distant plain, an inner sea of bracken and
heather. Ever the sound of water, of moaning
wave, of mingling rill, of foaming fall, the shrill
cry of eagle and curlew, and the melody of the
early birds. An hour hence should find me
trudging to Kilstern, away from the wild beauty
of this place—the home of Brases! On my
way back, I met my host, and mentioned my
intention. ‘That’s as it should be,’ was all he
said.</p>

<p>His curt approval galled me, and to silence
discourteous retort, I flung myself over the
stone ledge, and took the manor path like a
chased creature. With what unconscious
accuracy of observation I noted each leaf, each
colour and form of a scene memory was destined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to retain for evermore! following with
eager eyes the light as it made its own short
road of gold among the dense shadows, and
these as they picked out in blots the sunny
spaces.</p>

<p>The hall door as usual was open, and in
passing the portraits, I took my last look of the
boy with curls and ruffles, and beyond of the
girl with the proud fair face that might be a
portrait of Brases in younger days. I inspected
it steadily, and traced where resemblance
stopped in the lack of the subtle stamp of the
soul, the ennobling seal of grief. It was a
Brases who had never wept, never thought, a
creature of mere bodily beauty.</p>

<p>I found Trueberry walking up and down in
restless expectation. I could see that sight of
me brought an uncontrollable smart of disappointment
to his eyelids, and his expressive
mouth twitched like a child’s.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter, Gontran?’ he asked,
with an affectionate effort, and placed one hand
on my shoulder. ‘You look frightfully battered,
my poor fellow.’</p>

<p>‘Last night I meant to go away in silence,’ I
said, not able to meet his kind glance, ‘but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
to-day I decided I owed my friend a franker
course. Neither of us is responsible for the
fact, but we must separate now.’</p>

<p>‘You would desert me, Gontran—now!’ he
cried, and the bitter tone of his reproach fetched
a sob to my throat.</p>

<p>‘I wish to God it should not be, that I had
the unselfish courage to stay and witness your
happiness——’</p>

<p>‘Happiness!’ he shouted frantically. ‘My
poor boy, I am more miserable than yourself,’
he added, with a dejected movement.</p>

<p>‘Then you are deceiving yourself,’ I said,
shrugging and turning impatiently on my heel.
‘She loves you. I have seen it in her eyes,
felt it to the inmost fibres of consciousness in
her voice.’</p>

<p>‘And if it were so!’ Trueberry cried, in a soft,
fond tone of interjection, that brought my
fierce look back to his face. He called himself
miserable, but bliss sparkled out of the
depths of his frank eyes. He fronted daylight,
the proud and conscious lover, and the shadow
upon his radiance was, after all, but a becoming
tone to temper fatuity to my amazed and
acrid scrutiny. Without it, I might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
longed to strike him, in my state of moral
degradation.</p>

<p>‘How much nearer am I to her for that?’ he
went on, in reply to my hateful look. ‘My
dear friend, there is nothing for us both but to
take up our staff and knapsack, and trudge
wearily out of this enchanted valley into the
busy garish world, carrying with us the remembrance
of an unstable and beautiful dream. We
are equals in fortune, Gontran.’</p>

<p>‘Equals,’ I roared, goaded by the fiery bar
of his speech. ‘What equality exists between
success and unsuccess? between the chosen and
the neglected? between heat and cold, sun and
ice, glory and shame, tears and laughter? The
barrier to your happiness may be levelled by
fate at any moment. You have but to wait
and watch the newspapers. While I——’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be rough, old man. You would be
sorrier than I if you hurt me now, when I can
ill bear more pain. For I am dismissed, sent
away. Oh!’</p>

<p>He sat down and covered his face with
both hands, and I, in awakened wickedness of
spirit, gloated over his convulsive wretchedness.
Suffering had blunted conscience, and the finer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
feelings, and left me abjectly enslaved to all the
baser sensations that assail weakened humanity.
In such moments, happily brief, the savage is
uppermost, whatever the training of the gentleman.
The soul sleeps, and the body, with all
its frenzied needs and desires, stands naked,
primitive, elemental, the mere animal living
through the senses. The handsome sobbing
creature had all, and I had nothing. Yet he
dared to speak of equality in misery between us.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ I said, and moved to the door.</p>

<p>Trueberry sprang up, and clutched my arm.
His dear, simple nature could understand nothing
of the vileness that the finer and more
complex order of being may contain. To him
I was not an embittered rival, but a cherished
friend to whom he boyishly clung in his unbearable
sorrow.</p>

<p>‘Must we separate, Gontran?’ he entreated.
‘Why, since we both go to-day?’</p>

<p>The inalterable sweetness of his temper shook
me on a crest of remorse, and conquered assaulting
vindictiveness. I felt so mean beside him that
I could have begged his pardon for unuttered
insult. His superiority more than justified
Brases’ choice, though the dear fellow lacked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
my brains, and my name commanded considerable
stir.</p>

<p>I consented to go with him, and hurried back
to the cottage, where I found my host busy
over my portmanteau. I told him my friend
was coming with me too, upon which he scrutinised
my face mildly, and, I thought, with
satisfaction. He strapped the portmanteau,
and remarked in a dry tone: ‘That, too, is as
it should be, and I am glad there is no quarrel.’
Taking no note of my astonishment at his
incredible discernment, he added: ‘You’ll
drink a last drop of the mountain dew to your
success and happiness in another spot, sir,
where the girls, God bless them! are fresh and
pretty and plentiful as the flowers in May.’</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen, and I stood at the
window watching light chase shadow over the
bold visage of a reek, and assured myself
gloomily that there were a thousand ways, after
all, of threading a path through despair. Whose
life is crowned with happiness?—and hope of it
must come to an end sooner or later. Pleasure
still remains when we have shed the last tear,
and whatever may be said to the contrary
in pessimistic moments, pleasure to the last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
peeps out at us through the thorniest brambles,
with its varied allurements. This I told myself,
and though I could think of no possible
pleasure at the time, or compensation for the
miserable duty of facing life, I drearily supposed
I would come, like another, to find my round
of petty joys and mean delights. There was
something to be done even by a fellow so sick
at heart as I: books to be written, books to be
read, people to see, and people to avoid, countries
to travel in, and women to criticise. My
host stood at the top of the path, bareheaded,
cheering me on with his gracious ‘God speed
ye, sir!’ until the bend of the hill hid his honest
friendly face from me. I sought Trueberry in
his room, and saw his gloves, and hat, and portmanteau
on the table. I wandered about the
house, through unfamiliar chambers, till, on
lifting a curtain, a picture arrested me with a
curdling thrill. The blood flowed from heart
to brain on a dizzy wave, where it surged, so
that I had some knowledge of the sensation of
insanity. This explains my sin against honour
in standing there. I could not have left the
spot by any imperative order of conscience. I
stood as immovable as a hypnotised figure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Like a spectator of the drama, with feelings
unconcerned, I was quick to note the searching
pathos and beauty of the picture.</p>

<p>They two stood together in the middle of the
room, she with her hands on his shoulders, he
with an arm round her waist, holding one of her
little hands clasped above. The passionate gaze
of both was matchless in its eloquence. Both
faces were white and luminous, as if touched
with a ray from heaven, anguish adequately
mixed with transport. Such a look from a
woman’s eyes was surely worth dying for.</p>

<p>‘Brases, must I go away?’ Trueberry asked
brokenly.</p>

<p>She moved a little in his embrace, and pressed
her face against his breast, then recovered herself,
and said firmly—</p>

<p>‘You must, dear friend.’</p>

<p>‘Think of it, beloved,’ he cried, holding her
closer to him. ‘Such links as chain us. We
two as one, is it not madness to dream of living
apart? Every beat of life within you, Brases,
must cry out against this parting. It is murder
of our souls. Go, I may, but with you, Brases.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t make me go over it again,’ she pleaded,
in a tired voice, ‘it was so hard before. While
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
a man lives who calls me wife, can I come to
you with a tarnished name?’</p>

<p>‘Tarnished!’ The smile he shed upon her
was convincing enough to redeem a fallen
angel, it was so warm, and soft, and indulgent,
with all love’s sweetness and shelter. ‘The
stain is on his name, and that you would drop.
The law will release you. Come, come. You
cannot live alone now, any more than I can.
Think of what it means—craving light and
love and happiness, all within reach, and we
dying apart on the brink.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, don’t tempt me. Your desire is my
weakness. Your voice draws my being from
its roots, and my pulses beat to the rhythm of
yours. See how much I confess, and then be
merciful, and go.’</p>

<p>‘Is it always right to follow our ideal of duty,
when nature points so clearly another way?’
he still urged. ‘What reason have we always
to regard our judgment as better than hers,
since she is so big and mighty, and we so small
and helpless.’ He held her hand pressed against
his lips, and I could hear his murmuring speech
through the trembling fingers. ‘What is the
past with such a present as ours, such a future
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
as we might have? My love would soon blot
it from your memory. Trust me, Brases, I too
have my past with its burden of regrets I would
fain forget.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, had I met you before fatality crossed
my path,’ she said, upon a quick sob, ‘when my
palm was as clean as a child’s, how my spirit
would have bounded to the wedding of yours!
But that may never be now.’</p>

<p>Her arms dropped renouncingly, and the
smile that travelled slowly over her blanched
face shed a rapturous light upon his. His eyes
held hers in willing bondage. Though this was
her farewell I could divine the supreme effort
that kept her from his arms, by the fingers
fluttering like the wings of a bird against her
dress, while it were hard to say which her half-lifted,
gently averted face, with the eyes straining
back to his, most eloquently expressed:
surrender or renouncement.</p>

<p>Trueberry sprang to her and caught her to
him, and their lips met in a kiss that had the
solemnity of a sacrament. I staggered back,
clapping my hand over my mouth to prevent
a shout of white-hot anguish, and could see the
darkness sweep down upon me like a big comforting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
wing. I hoped it was death come to
gather me like a suffering, inarticulate child,
into its soft mother’s arms.</p>

<p>But I struggled back into life, and had again
to front the road of care and blind endeavour.
How long later I cannot say, but I saw Brases
standing over me, looking at me in pitying
wonder. She took my hand in both of hers,
and bending, softly kissed my cheek. This
was the mother’s kiss I hoped death had
given me. I stared at her, too broken for
wonder or emotion, and sitting down beside
me, with my hand still in hers, she said—</p>

<p>‘We were very much frightened, you were so
long unconscious. Mr. Trueberry told me you
have not slept of late, and that you are very
unhappy. I, too, am unhappy, and that is why
I kissed you. But you are better now, and you
will try to forget your pain, or, at least, to bear
it well. It is the best any of us can do. They
will drive you to Kilstern, and you will return
to France alone, carrying my best wishes
for your welfare. Mr. Trueberry has gone
already.’</p>

<p>I struggled to my feet, swallowed the wine
she poured out for me, and then, in a dull,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
uneager voice, asked, ‘Did Trueberry leave no
message for me, Madame?’</p>

<p>‘He was very much concerned, and full of
sympathy, but he has his own trouble to bear,
and thinks he will bear it best alone. He will
write to you to Paris in a few days.’</p>

<p>A trap was at the door, and she came out
with me, and when we had shaken hands in
silence, stood looking after me, as I was indeed
forcibly carried away. She was dim to my
sight, a mere blurred grey figure, with light
about her head, and the landscape looked watery
and broken, as if seen through bits of bobbing
glass.

<p><span class="smcap">T<b>HERE</b></span> was a break in the soft stream of
Rameau’s eloquence when somebody spoke of
Krowtosky. The interruption came from Louis
Gaston, a brilliant young journalist, whose air of
sanctified rake and residence in the Rue du Bac,
in front of a well-known shop, earned him the
nickname of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Petit Saint Thomas</i>.</p>

<p>Krowtosky’s name diverted the channel of
the murmurous, half-abstracted discourse to
which we had lent an attentive ear, physically
lulled, and though charmed, not boisterously
amused by Rameau’s sly anecdotal humour and
complaisant lightness of tone. Rameau always
talked delightfully, without any apparent consciousness
of the fact; above all, without any
apparent effort. He never raised his voice,
gesticulated slightly, accentuated no point, and
left much to his listener’s discretion; and his
calm drollery was all the more delicious because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
of the sedate and equable expression of his
handsome face.</p>

<p>‘Krowtosky,’ he repeated, as he turned his
picturesque grey head in Gaston’s direction;
with a deliberate air he removed his glasses,
slowly polished them, and interjected, ‘Ah!’</p>

<p>‘You must remember that queer Russian
who used to hold forth here some years ago,’
Louis Gaston continued, in an explanatory tone;
‘a heavy, unemotional fellow, with desperate
views. He began by amusing us, and ended
by nearly driving us mad with his eternal
<i>Nirvana</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes,’ somebody else cried, suddenly
spurred to furnish further reminiscences. ‘His
trousers were preternaturally wide, and his
coat-sleeves preternaturally short. You always
imagined that he carried dynamite in his
pockets, and apprehended an explosion if you
accidentally threw a lighted match or a half-smoked
cigarette in his neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>‘He had small eyes, and a big nose, the head
of an early Gaul, and a hollow voice,’ I remarked.</p>

<p>‘A monster to convince the Tartars themselves
of their superior ugliness, if they entertained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
any doubt of it,’ half lisped a Frenchman
recently crowned by the Academy, and as
unconscious of his own ill-looks as only a man,
and above all a Frenchman, can be.</p>

<p>‘The good-nature of your remarks and your
keen remembrance of Krowtosky prove that he
must be a personage in his way,’ said Rameau
mockingly.</p>

<p>‘What became of him?’ asked Le Petit Saint
Thomas, between slow puffs of his cigarette.</p>

<p>‘Poor fellow! He has fallen upon grief.’</p>

<p>‘Naturally; it is the great result of birth. A
love affair?’</p>

<p>‘Worse.’</p>

<p>‘Blasphemy, Professor! ’Tis the sole sorrow
of life. The rest are but the trifling ills of
humanity.’ Gaston spoke with all the authority
of a young man who is perpetually in and
out of love, is backed upon the thorny path
of literature by rich and devoted relatives, and
has never known a day’s illness upon his road.</p>

<p>‘It can’t be marriage, for that violent resource
would merely drift him into deeper depths of
Pessimism, which would be a gratifying confirmation
of his theories.’</p>

<p>‘It can’t be love either,’ I suggested. ‘Pessimism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
and love don’t mate. Marriage it might
be; for even a pessimist may be conceded the
weakness of objecting to a demonstration of
the nothingness of marriage in the person of
his own wife.’</p>

<p>‘It might be debt, if that were not a modified
trouble since the inhuman law of imprisonment
was abolished.’</p>

<p>‘Behold the force of imagination, Professor,’
exclaimed Gaston, pointing to a visionary perspective
with his cigarette, in answer to
Rameau’s glance of contemplative irony. ‘I
see our monster married to an unvirtuous
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisette</i>, or an amiable young laundress, who
discovers the superior attractiveness of an
optimist poet on the opposite side of the way.
She can hardly be blamed for the discovery; for
though we may applaud the courage of a
woman who marries a monster, it would be
both rash and cruel to expect her to add fidelity
to her courage. Where women are concerned,
it is a wise precaution to count upon a single
virtue.’</p>

<p>‘Your wit, the outcome of natural perversity,
flies beyond the mark,’ said Rameau, shrugging
his shoulders. ‘The real sorrows of life are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
very simple, and command respect by their
simplicity. The others are the complications,
the depravities of civilisation at which
we cavil and laugh. Krowtosky has not
stumbled in double life, but he has just lost
a baby girl.’</p>

<p>There was dead silence. A perceptible start
of emotion found expression in an interjectionary
arch of brow, a sigh blown on the puff
of a cigarette, and an uneasy shifting of
attitudes. A baby girl! What a slight thing
in the hurry of life, what a simple thing in its
crowding perplexities! The tragic end of men
and women whom the years have worn and
fretted; the sudden death of happy youth in
the midst of its bright promises; the peaceful
sadness that accompanies the departure of the
old, who have honourably lived their lives and
accomplished all natural laws:—but the closed
eyes of a little baby girl! What is it more than
tumble of a new-born bird from its nest, leaving
no empty space? Upon a boy paternal pride
might have feasted, and the sting might remain
that new avenues to fame and fortune were
closed by his sharp withdrawal.</p>

<p>Yet despite the insignificance of the loss,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
none of the faces round Rameau wore a look of
indifference or surprise. For a moment each
man was serious, touched, and uninclined for
wit at poor Krowtosky’s expense. Upon
dropped lids I seemed to see the big grotesque
head, so full of honesty and strife, bent in
grief over an empty cradle; and I was wrung
by a smart of anger when Gaston lightly
asked, ‘Is there then a legitimate Madame
Krowtosky?’</p>

<p>‘All that is most legitimate,’ replied Rameau
gravely.</p>

<p>‘You have followed the story?’</p>

<p>‘Since I played the part of confidential
friend—why, I know as little as you.’</p>

<p>‘And the lady?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, the lady! Her I only know on report
that cannot exactly be described as impartial.’</p>

<p>‘Is it a story worth telling?’</p>

<p>‘In its way it is curious enough, especially
unfolded in the illumination of Krowtosky’s
jumble of crude philosophy and speculative
theories, and, above all, told in his queer
French. He has honoured me with a correspondence
in the form of a journal. It is
extremely interesting, and I have preserved it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Some day I will publish it,—when the philosopher
is dead, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Then begin now, my dear Professor,’ I urged.
‘Try its effect <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en petit comité</i>.’ We read assent
in the Professor’s way of crossing his legs, while
he drew one hand slowly round the back of
his head. When he had carefully polished and
adjusted his glasses, each of us chose a commodious
attitude, and looked expectantly at
him. After a pause, Rameau began in his soft
conversational tone, subdued like the indefinite
shade of the lamp-screen that cast its glimmer
over heads and profiles, showing vaguely upon
a background of dull tapestries.</p>

<p>‘Krowtosky looked much older than his age.
He was, in fact, very young, Pessimism being
one of the most pronounced symptoms of the
malady of youth. He is still young, and the
malady has yet some years to run. He came
here with a letter to me from an old friend in
Moscow, and a very big bundle of hopes.</p>

<p>‘I hardly know what he expected to make
of Paris, but Paris, I imagine, made nothing of
him. I did what I could for him, which was
not much, and from the first I had no illusions
whatever upon the nature of his probable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
success. I found a lady ambitious to read
Turgenieff and Tolstoï in Russian. I sent
Krowtosky to her; but after the second lesson
she dismissed him on the plea of his unearthly
ugliness; his heavy Calmuck face diverted her
attention from Turgenieff’s charming women
and Tolstoï’s philosophy, and gave her nightmares.
I encouraged the poor fellow to come
here, which he did, and most of you met him
frequently. He was interesting in his way,
very, but crude and boundlessly innocent. He
had the queerest notions upon all things, and
having sounded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Décadents</i>, he professed to
find them hollow. I think he suspected those
gentlemen of an unreasonable sanity and an
underhand enjoyment of life. The French
Realists he dismissed as caricaturists; he said
they were reading for the devil when he was
drunk and in a merry mood. I daresay he
meant the Czar.</p>

<p>‘He railed at the mock decay of modern
civilised life, and imagined that a glimpse of
Pessimism beyond the Pyrenees would prove
instructive. He was convinced that he would
find it there of less noxious quality, exhibiting
the sombre melancholy and dignity of a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
race fallen into poetic decay and unvexed by
the wearisome febrile conditions of its development
here. “You understand nothing of the
spirit of calm fatality,” he would say, apostrophising
the nation in my humble person for lack of
a more enlightened audience. “You are everlastingly
in strife with your own emotions and
despairs; and these you decorate, as you idly
decorate your persons, with persistent vanity
and with wasteful care.” I deprecated the
charge upon my own account, and assured
him that it took me exactly four minutes
to decorate my person each morning. Four
minutes, I claimed, cannot be described as an
exorbitant charge upon Time for the placing
and adjusting of eighteen articles, and as he
seemed to doubt the number, I told them off,
including my hat and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pince-nez</i>. I mentioned
a few Frenchmen who I thought accepted the
luxury of unemotional despair calmly enough,
and were as incapable of strife as a tortoise.
He shook his head; he was not easily to be
convinced. His Pessimism was so black that
our sombre Maupassant was a captivating
Optimist beside him. And provided with this
meagre intellectual baggage, he set out for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
half-forgotten and ruined lands, beginning with
Spain.’</p>

<p>‘He fell in for a fortune, I suppose,’ Gaston
interrupted.</p>

<p>‘He had not a sou, which is the best explanation
of an expensive voyage. Remark, my
friends, that a man only becomes really extravagant
and reckless upon an empty purse. An
empty purse and an empty stomach are equally
effectual in producing light-headedness, and
vest us in the cloak of illusion. Illusion I
opine to be one of the things that look best
in rags. Krowtosky travelled third class, and
was prodigiously uncomfortable, which, after
all, is another method of enjoying life upon his
theory. He ate Bologna sausages, and refreshed
himself with grapes upon the wayside.</p>

<p>‘His first letter was dated from Bayonne.
It was a long and a curious letter, and so
interested me that I resolved to follow up the
correspondence with vigorous encouragement,
for it was not an occasion to be missed by a
student of mankind. I will read you some
extracts from these letters, which I have here
in a drawer of my writing-table.’</p>

<p>The packet of letters found, Rameau went on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
reading, with the perfect and polished irony
and charm of enunciation that could cast an
intellectual glamour over an auctioneer’s inventory.
‘“I have chosen you as the recipient
of the impressions and incidents of my voyage,—why,
I hardly know; I am not inspired by
any strong sympathy for you. My esteem and
my liking are very moderate indeed; you have
a face that rather repels than invites confidence,
and I ought to be discouraged by the fact that
I have no faith in your sympathy for me, and
have every conviction that you are the last
person likely to understand me. The friend
who would understand me, and for whom I
should enjoy writing these impressions and the
adventures that may lie ahead, is at present
voyaging in far-off waters; I think he is somewhere
about the Black Sea, but I don’t know
his address, or when or where communication
might chance to reach him. So, having cast
about me for a confidant, choice alighted upon
you; but you need not read my letters if they
bore you. They are written rather for my own
gratification than for yours. If I possessed
literary talent, the public would be my natural
victim....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>‘This was a flattering beginning, you will
admit, but it sharpened my curiosity. After
that I began to look forward to Krowtosky’s
post-day, as some people look forward to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilleton</i> of the morning paper. His queer
minute handwriting never found me indifferent
or unexpectant of diversion.</p>

<p>‘At Toulouse he wrote again: “A young girl
got into the carriage with me. We were alone,
and she soon gave me a visible demonstration
of the strange eccentricities oddly explained by
the single word <i>love</i>. Why <i>love</i>? It is simply
a malady more or less innocuous and only
sometimes deadly; but love, no! I was not
flattered; I am above that weakness, because
nothing pleases me. I was interested, however,
and investigated the case with scientific calm.
So might any physician have diagnosed a disease.
It struck me for the first time as a form
of mild insanity. I asked myself why the poets
and romancers amuse themselves in writing of
it rather than of the other fevers and bodily
illnesses that overcome us. For everything
about this young girl convinced me that love is
but a sickness. I studied her gestures, her expression,
her tones of voice and her attitudes;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
all served to prove my theory. One minute I
offered to open the window, and the next I
suggested that perhaps it would be better to
close it. She assented. Though curious, it was
rather monotonous, but she assented to everything
I proposed. If I looked at her, she
looked at me; if I looked away, she continued
to look at me. After a couple of hours’ study,
I felt that I quite understood love and all its
phases. I found it in the main a silly game,
and an excitement only fit for brainless boys
and girls in their first youth. But the most
remarkable feature of humanity is its crass
stupidity; it is a monstrously shabby and feeble
institution, male and female. This young girl,
now; I daresay you and others would call her
pretty. Bah! I can see but the ugliness of
women. Behind their forehead thought does
not work; their eyes only express the meanest
and most personal sentiments. Big black
empty eyes and sensual red lips; a round lazy
figure and nerveless hands! I protest there is
more intelligence and matter for study in a dog
than in these insipid creatures, all curves and
no muscles. Men, say they, don’t understand
them. Are dolls worth understanding? They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
are actuated solely by impulse and personal
claims. What is there in this worth understanding?
I escaped from my conquest, now grown
irksome, upon the frontier, and I am resolved
never to give evidence of a similar weakness.
It is degrading folly. What, for instance, can
women see in us to inspire this most infelicitously-called
tender passion, and, in the name
of all that is eternal, what are we supposed to
see in them to justify it?...”’</p>

<p>‘A sympathetic dog, to go snarling in that
cantankerous way through life because the
Almighty has seen fit to cast a flower or two
across his path,’ growled the indignant Petit
Saint Thomas, to whom love was the main
object of existence.</p>

<p>‘Scenery does not interest him much,’ Rameau
went on, with an acquiescent nod; ‘but he has
a good deal to say upon his impressions of the
Spanish race in particular, and of all other races
in general. The subject is not a new one, and
Krowtosky is only really entertaining when he
is talking of himself, or of his next-door neighbour
in connection with himself.</p>

<p>‘“I am on the whole much disappointed in
Madrid,” he continues further on, “not because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
it is a duller town than I had imagined, but
because local colour and national individuality
are almost extinct. It proves the disastrous
tendencies of all races to amalgamation and
imitation. Yet, after all, Rameau, what is the
real value of local colour? It is more often
than not a mere matter of imagination, and
one of the illusions we fancy we enjoy. Any
one with a lively imagination can invent a
more vivid local colour for all the countries he
has never visited than he is likely to find in
any of them. Witness Merimée and his band.
They duped their public like the vulgarest
literary conjurors, and showed us that a trick
will serve us instead of what we are pleased to
call Nature. And the deception was but the
result of our stupid hunger for the unusual.
As if anything under the monotonous stars of
an unchanging heaven can be unusual; and as
if everything in this old and ugly world is not
hideously familiar! The more varied our
travels the more similar our experience. For,
Rameau, our real ills are monotony and
stupidity. Man resembles man, as rats resemble
rats, only he is a good deal less interesting
and more noxious. You have a fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
head, and I have a misshapen one. Well, the
same perplexities, needs, instincts, appetites,
passions, and impulses agitate us, and explain
our different actions, which, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fond</i>, have no
variety in them whatever. We change the
symbols of our faiths, while these remain fundamentally
the same, and we give our countries
different names to represent the unchangeable
miseries of humanity....”</p>

<p>‘Here you have the malady of youth in its
crisis. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décadent</i> poet could not chant more
lugubriously, though perhaps less intelligibly.
The sick youth laments in the same irritable
tone the vulgarity of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">madrileñas</i>, the exaggerated
prowess of the gentlemen of the
arena, exalts the patient and noble bulls, rails
at the puny byplay of the picadors and at the
silly enthusiasm of the spectators. He rushes
distractedly from an inexpensive inn, where a
band of merry rascals joined him and over
wine sang the praises of the Fair. Praise of
the eternal feminine he cannot stand. Poor
wretch! Had he been Adam in the Garden
of Paradise, Eden would have ceased to be
Eden upon the impertinent introduction of
Eve. We find him complaining that he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
have left a score of maundering youths in
Paris doing dismal homage to the Sex, to
drop upon a sillier band in Madrid hymning
the everlasting subject. He protests the
Spanish women, for all their eyes and arched
feet, are untempting and insipid, like the rest.
They are not the dolls of the North; they are
the animals of the South. He confines his
curiosity to Spanish literature, and is in pursuit
of its apostle of Pessimism. “I am taking
lessons in Spanish,” he writes from another
inn. “I teach Russian to as poor a devil as
myself, in exchange for his help in his own
tongue. Between us we are making creditable
progress. He is writing an article on the
Russian novelists for a review that will pay
him something like twopence a page. Yet he
preserves his faith in literature! Mighty indeed
is man’s capacity for cherishing illusions.
I advised him to break stones for a lucrative
change, but he seems to doubt the value of
the advice since I do not follow it myself.
This is one of the things that prove man a
rational being. We read Castrès together. You
have doubtless heard of Castrès, the poet of
Spain, and said to be sufficiently sedative as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
regards the happy hopes of youth. Such is
my Spaniard’s description in reply to a question
of mine upon his tendencies. I have inserted
the phrase as a concession to the perverse taste
for local colouring. The phrase paints the
man; he lives upon onions and bread into the
bargain, and dreams with a cigarette between
his lips. This morning I went to see Castrès....
I found the great man writing and smoking
at the same time in a big sparsely furnished
bedroom. He is low-sized and heavily built,
with soft black eyes and a forest of hair round
and about his sallow face. He looks as if he
dined well and liked women. There is always
something unctuous and fatuous about a man
who likes women, which becomes intolerably
accentuated if women should happen to like
him too. The expression suggests a mixture
of oil and sugar. We discussed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Décadents</i>
under their new name, and hardly appreciated
the advantage of exchange, symbolism being
no whit less empty and vapid; another demonstration
of the worthlessness of novelty, since,
however much we vary things, we end where
we start, at the Unchangeable. Castrès agrees
with me that Naturalism is dead; but what the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
devil, he asked, is going to take its place?
Naturalism under a new name, I replied, which
is only romance upside down. Whether we
invent animals or angels, it matters little. It
is romancing all the same, and only proves that
one man likes <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau sucrée</i> and another likes
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">absinthe</i>. It is a concoction either way, and
about as useful in one form as in the other....
Of Castrès the man I thought as indifferently
as I did of Castrès the poet. I asked him how
Pessimism stood in Spain, and who were its representatives.
He shrugged, spat, and surveyed
me dismissingly, and with his big soft eyes....
‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caramba!</i> I can’t say I know much about
it. But I believe it will never flourish here.
We have too much sun, and life is, on the
whole, easy enough for us. An hour of sunshine,
a crust of bread, and a bunch of grapes,
or the taste of an onion and a lifted wine-skin
upon the roadside, and there you have a
Spaniard built and ready for love-making.
What more does he want? And in a land
where women are fair and facile, wherefore
should he whine, and see black where God
made blue? I have here a volume of poems just
published by a young girl—Señorita Pilar Villafranca
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
y Nuño. I have glanced through the
volume, and I don’t think you can ask for anything
finer in the way of Pessimism. It is
enough to make a sane man cut his throat, if
he had not the good sense to pause beforehand,
in distrust of the sincerity of the writer who
could survive the proof-reading of such dismal
stuff. It reminds me of what I have heard of
Schopenhauer, who, after wrecking all our
altars, could sit down and enjoy a heavy dinner.
He despised none of the pleasures of life in
practice, while decrying them all in theory.
You’ll probably find that this young woman
dines heartily, and employs her evenings over
her wedding outfit, if she is not already married
and nursing her first baby. I took the book
away and read it with my poor devil that
evening. You will not be surprised to learn
that I found it very much superior to anything
of Castrès’ I have read. He might
well sneer at her in self-preservation, that
being the weapon the strong have ever preferred
to use against the weak. It is bad
enough to find real talent in a young
woman, but absolute unbelief, the doctrine
of complete negation! To find in this land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
of To-morrow, a feminine apostle of the
<i>Nirvana</i>....”’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ interrupted Gaston, ‘I was wondering
what had become of the word.’</p>

<p>‘“A feminine apostle of the <i>Nirvana</i>,”’ continued
Rameau, with an expressive smile.
‘“Judge if masculine opinion in Spain would
be indulgent. Even my poor devil, though no
less struck than I with the poetry, found it
much too strong for a woman. ‘But she is
doubtless old, and then it matters less. The
discontents and disappointments of old maidenhood
have drifted her into deep learning and
irreligion,’ he added, by way of consolation.
‘Old or young,’ I exclaimed, ‘it is all one to
me. For me she is a thinker, not a woman.
And I am going straight off to her publisher,
from whom I’ll wrest her address, if need be,
by reason of a thick stick.’</p>

<p>‘“The services of a stick were not required.
My request was immediately complied with.
I carried the lady’s book in my hand, and was
no doubt mistaken for a recent purchaser. My
poet lives on the fourth floor in a very shabby
house, in a very shabby street at the other end
of Madrid. I deemed it wise to defer my visit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
until after dinner. It was half-past eight when
I climbed the four flights, and stood on the
landing, anxiously asking myself if I had made
up my mind to ring. Had it not the air of an
invasion? While I was yet debating the door
opened, and an untidy-looking maid shot out
into the passage. I captured her before the
twilight of the stairs had swallowed her, and
demanded to see the Señorita Pilar Villafranca
y Nuño. I understood that it would not serve
me in her eyes to give evidence of uncertainty
or bashfulness. ‘She is inside; knock at the
middle door and you’ll find her,’ screamed the
untidy maid, and in another moment she was
whirling down the stairs, and I was left to shut
the hall door and announce myself.</p>

<p>‘“The house was tidier than the maid. I
crossed a scrupulously clean hall and knocked
at the middle door, as I had been directed. A
low, deep voice shouted, <i>Come in!</i> While turning
the handle gingerly, I thought to myself,
the poor devil was right; only a woman of
massive proportions and very advanced years
could bellow that order. The scene that met
my eyes was prettier than absolute conformity
to my ideas demanded. In a neat little sitting-room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
lit by a shaded lamp, were seated three
persons; a stout Spanish woman engaged with
a basket of stockings, a pale, thin young girl
with melancholy eyes of an unusual intensity
of gaze, and a small lad sitting at her feet, and
reading aloud from a book they held together.
The child had the girl’s eyes, but while curiosity,
belonging to his years, brightened their sombreness
with the promise of surprise and laughter,
hers held an expression of permanent sadness
and soft untroubled gloom. It was superfluous
information on the mother’s part, in response to
my mention of the poet’s name, to indicate her
daughter majestically, as if she wished it to be
understood that she herself had no part in the
production of matter so suspicious in a woman
as poetry. I was on the brink of assuring her
that nobody would ever deem her capable of
such folly, and begging her to return to her
stockings as occupation more appropriate than
the entertainment of an admirer of the Muse
she despised, when Pilar quietly said, ‘Be seated,
sir.’ From that moment I took no further heed
of the Señora Villafranca than if she had been
the accommodating <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dueña</i> of Spanish comedy
and I the unvirtuous, or noble but thwarted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
lover who had bribed her. In ten minutes Pilar
and I were talking as freely as if we had known
one another from infancy; far more freely,
possibly, for in the latter case we should long
ago have talked ourselves to silence. How do
these young girls manage to get hold of books,
Rameau, when all the forces of domestic law
are exercised to keep them apart? There is
not a living Spanish or French writer with
whom this child, barely out of her teens, is not
acquainted. Her judgment may often be at
fault,—whose is not, if backed by anything like
originality? But to hear her discuss Naturalism!
Castrès, puffing his eternal cigarette,
walks you through <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les lieux communs</i>, but this
girl takes flights that fairly dazzle you. And
then her Pessimism! The queer thing is that
she has found it for herself, and Schopenhauer
has nothing to do with it. For that matter,
nobody living or dead seems to have had anything
to do with the forming of her. She is
essentially <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primesautière</i>. You French do manage
to hit upon excellent words; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primesautière</i>
perfectly describes this Spanish maid. She is
all herself, first of the mould, fresh, though so
burdened with the century’s malady. So young,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and she believes in nothing—but nothing, Rameau!
She hopes for nothing, for nothing!
She plays with no emotions, feigns no poetic
despairs, utters no paradoxes, and is simplicity
itself in her gestures, expressions, and ideas.
She calmly rejects all the pretty illusions of
her sex, without a pang or regret, because, for
her, truth is above personal happiness.</p>

<p>‘“We talked, we talked—talked till far into
the night, while the fat mother slumbered
noisily in her chair, and the little boy slept
curled up at his sister’s feet. Can you guess
what first put it into my head to go? The
smell of the lamp as the wick flickeringly
lowered. ‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dios mio!</i>’ cried Pilar, ‘it is close
on two o’clock, and we have been chattering
while my mother sleeps comfortlessly in
her chair, and my little brother is dreaming on
the carpet instead of in his bed. Good-night,
sir; I must leave you and carry my baby to
bed.’ She stooped and lifted the sleeping boy
with her arms. Such bodily strength in one so
frail much astonished me. I would have offered
her help, but the little lad had already found
a comfortable spot in the hollow of her neck,
and with a cordial nod to me she disappeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
into the inner room. I had not expected this
evidence of womanly tenderness from her, and
the picture haunted me on my way down the
dark staircase and through the dim starlit
streets.”</p>

<p>‘The extracts from the next letters are singularly
characteristic,’ said Rameau, well pleased
by our profound attention. ‘Krowtosky, upon
his return to Paris, has taken a third-class
ticket from Madrid to Bayonne. To the poet
he has said his last farewell, and probably wears
upon his heart her precious autograph. Not that
Krowtosky is ostensibly sentimental. He rejects
the notion of such folly, and if by chance he
dropped into pretty fooling, be sure he would
find a philosophical way out of the disgrace
deservedly attached to such weakness. “I am
travelling to Bayonne,” he writes, “and I will
reach it to-morrow afternoon, but I am convinced
that once there I shall straightway take the train
back to Madrid. Odd, is it not? Yet I feel
that I shall be compelled to return to that young
girl. And this is not love, mark you, Rameau;
not in the least. I know all about that. Did
I not study it in the case of that young girl
I met at Toulouse? Well, nothing I feel for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Pilar in any way resembles the foolish sentiment
her gestures and looks expressed. I am
quite master of myself, and do not hang on any
one’s lips or glances; but I must see Pilar again.
Do you know why I hesitated outside her door
that first evening I called upon her? I had a
presentiment, as I climbed up those stairs,
that I should marry her. We may reject a faith
in presentiments, but they shake us nevertheless.
How slowly this train goes! The landscape,
across which we speed in the leisurely
movement of Spanish steam, is flat and ugly, an
interminable view of cornfields. There is a
wide-hatted priest in front of me with an open
breviary in his hand. Perhaps I shall find
myself craving service of one of his brothers
some day. What an odd fellow I am, to be
sure! I intend, oh certainly I intend to take
the Paris train to-morrow night from Bayonne,
and as certainly I know I shall find myself on
my way back to Madrid! And it cannot be for
the pleasure of passing a couple of days and
nights in a beastly third-class carriage, which is
nothing better here than a cattle-pen....”</p>

<p>‘Of his reception by the poet, of his sentiments
and wooing, he writes very sparingly. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
great terror is that I should detect the lover
where he insists there is only a philosopher.
Philosophy took him from Madrid, and
Philosophy brought him back within forty-eight
hours. Philosophy sued, wooed, and won the
Muse, and led him to his wedding-morn.
While engaged in its service, he writes in this
jocose strain the very evening of his marriage:
“This morning in a dark little church, in a dark
little street of Madrid, we were married. Though
neither of us believes in anything, we agreed to
make the usual concession to conventional
feeling and social law, and were married in the
most legal and Christianlike fashion. Nothing
was lacking,—neither rings nor signatures, nor
church-bells nor church-fees, nor yet the
excellent and venerable fat priest, a degree
uglier than myself, who obligingly made us one.
While this ceremony was being performed, I
could not forget the inconvenient fact that
neither of us brought the other much in the
shape of promise of future subsistence, not even
hope, of which there is not a spark between us.
This preoccupation distracted me while the priest
mumbled and sermonised, and a wicked little
French couplet kept running through my head:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Un et un font deux, nombre heureux en galanterie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mais quand un et un font trois,—c’est diablerie!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the fat priest discoursed to my wife,
most excellently, upon the duties and virtues of
the true Christian spouse, to which discourse
my wife lent an inattentive ear. Perhaps she
also was thinking of the future,—somewhat
tardily. My dear Rameau, have you ever
reflected upon the amazing one-sidedness of religion
on these occasions? Wives are eloquently
exhorted to practise all the virtues, and not a
word is flung at the husbands. It is something
of course for us to learn, by the aid of the
Church, that all the duty is on the other side,
and that we have nothing to do but command,
be worshipped, and fall foul of infidelity. The
beautiful logic of man, and the profound Pessimism
of woman! She never rebels, but accepts
all without hope of remedy. The real Pessimists
are women. They admit the fact that everything
is unalterable, evil without amelioration;
everything is, and everything will remain to the
end. Man occasionally rises up, and takes his
oppressor by the throat, but woman never.
There is a point at which his patience vanishes,
but hers is inexhaustible. She is the soul and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
spirit and body of the malady only diagnosed
this century. Conviction that suffering is her only
heritage is hers before birth, and she placidly
bends to the law of fate often without a murmur,
always without the faintest instinct of revolt.
Is she an idiot or an angel? The latter rebelled
in paradise; then she must be an idiot. Man
is activity, she is inertia; that is why she yields
so readily to his ruling. These are thoughts
suitable to the marriage of two Pessimists.
There will be on neither side revolt or stupid
demands upon destiny. I am simply interested
in the development of this strange union of
the barbarous North and the barbarous South,
and watch this unfamiliar person, my wife,
placed in an enervating proximity by a queer
social institution. I wonder if she will eventually
prove explosive; meantime it is my
privilege to kiss her. I have not mentioned it,
but she has very sweet lips.”</p>

<p>‘After this there is a long lapse of silence. I
fear the delights of poor Krowtosky’s honeymoon
were soon enough disturbed by the grim
question of ways and means. As I was only a
fair-weather friend in default of the sympathetic
confidant voyaging in distant waters, I imagine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
at this period the traveller must have returned,
and received the rest of the journal so wantonly
intrusted to me, or Krowtosky must have confided
his troubles to his wife. When next I
hear from him, it is many months later, and he
has just obtained a professorship in a dreary
snow-bound place called Thorpfeld. From his
description, it is evidently the very last place
God Almighty bethought himself of making,
and by that time all the materials of comfort,
pleasure, and beauty had been exhausted. “As
Thorpfeld is not my birthplace,” writes Krowtosky,
“I may befoul it to my liking. It
contains about seven thousand inhabitants, one
poorer and more ignorant than another. What
they can want with professors and what the
authorities are pleased to call a college, the
wicked government under which we sweat and
suffer and groan alone can tell. Six out of a
hundred cannot read, and three of these can
barely write. The less reason have they for
a vestige of belief in man, the more fervent
is their faith in their Creator. Nothing but
anticipation of the long-delayed joys of paradise
can keep them from cutting their own and their
neighbours’ throats. They ought to begin with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
the professors and the rascally magistrates.
As if snow and broken weather were not enough
to harass these poor wretches in pursuit of a
precarious livelihood, what little money the
magistrates or the professors leave them is wrung
from them by the popes. Even Pilar is demoralised
by her surroundings. She has left
off writing pessimistic poetry, and has betaken
herself to Christian charity. ’Tisn’t much we
can do, for we have barely enough to live upon
ourselves, but that little she manages to do somehow
or other. These hearts of foolish women
will ever make them traitor to their heads. I
naturally growl when I find our sack of corn
diminished in favour of a neighbour’s hungry
children, or return frost-bitten from the college
to find no fire, and learn that my wife has
carried a basket of fuel to a peasant dying up
among snow-hills. She does not understand
these people, and they do not understand her,
but they divine her wish to share their wretchedness,
her own being hardly less; and then she
is a pretty young woman! Timon himself
could hardly have spurned her. But where’s
her Pessimism? Has it vanished with the sun
and vines of her own bright land, or has it found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
a grave in the half-frozen breast of a strange
Sister of Charity unknown to me and born of
the sight of snow-clad misery such as in Spain
is never dreamed of? You see, I am on the
road to poetry instead of my poor changed
young wife.</p>

<p>‘“Last evening when I came home from a
farmer’s house, where I had stopped to warm
myself with a couple of glasses of <i>vodka</i>, I
found her shivering over the remaining sparks
of a miserable fire. She looked so white and
unhappy and alone, so completely the image of
a stranger in a foreign land, to whom I, too,
her husband, am a foreigner, that I asked
myself, in serious apprehension, if I might
not be destined to lose her in the coming
crisis. ‘Pilar,’ I cried, ‘what ails thee?’ And
when she turned her head I saw that she was
crying silently. ‘I want my own land; I want
the sun and vines of Spain, where at least the
peasants have wine and sunshine in abundance
whatever else they may lack!’ I should think so,
I grimly muttered, remembering that over there
the mortar that built up the walls of a town was
wet with wine instead of water, and that fields
are sometimes moistened with last year’s wine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
when the new is ready. Pilar is right, my
friend. There is no poverty so sordid and
awful as that of the cold North. But what
could I do? I could not offer her the prospect
of change. She was sobbing bitterly now, and
I had no words of comfort for her. If only she
had not forsaken her principles and her poetry!
But the baby may rouse her when it comes.
She has not smiled since we left Spain,
poor girl. We must wait meanwhile; but
Rameau, it is very cold.”’</p>

<p>‘Poor little woman!’ murmured Gaston. ‘I
hardly know which is the worst fortune for her,
her transplantation or her marriage with that
maundering owl Krowtosky. Krowtosky married
to a pretty Spanish poet! Ye gods, it is
a cruel jest! There would have been some
appropriateness in the laundress or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisette</i>,
but a Spanish girl with arched feet and melancholy
eyes! I vow the jade Destiny ought
to have her neck wrung for it. Is there a
Perseus among us to free this modern unhappy
Andromeda?’</p>

<p>‘Poor Krowtosky! he deserves a word too,’
I modestly ventured to suggest, touched by
that little stroke, <i>It is very cold</i>, and his fear of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
losing his wife. ‘He is more human than he
himself is aware, and we may be sorry for
him too.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes,’ assented Rameau, and he dropped
an easy sigh. ‘If he is a bear, he is an honest
bear. His next letter was just a note to
announce the birth of a little girl and the well-being
of the mother, which was followed by a
more philosophical communication later, as soon
as the gracious content of motherhood had
fallen upon the young Spaniard. Relieved of
his fears, he plunges once again into high speculation,
and throws out queer suggestions as to
the result of such conflicting elements in parentage
as those contributed by Spain and Russia.
He has found an occupation of vivid interest,—that
of watching the development of his child,
which he is convinced will turn out something
very curious. Pilar, he adds, has so far recovered
her old self as to have written a delicious little
poem, which has just appeared in the <i>Revista</i>.
It is over there, if any of you can read Spanish.’</p>

<p>‘And the baby is now dead,’ said Gaston.</p>

<p>‘Dead, yes, poor mite! It had not time to
show what the mingling of Spanish and Russian
blood might mean. Krowtosky’s letter was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
most pitiful. That I will not read to you; it
affected me too deeply. It was the father there
who wrote. Unconsciously the little creature
had forced a way into his heart, and discovered
it a very big and human heart despite his
Pessimism and Philosophy. What hurt him
most was the cruel hammering of nails into the
baby’s coffin, and the sound keeps haunting him
through the long wakeful nights. Of the bereaved
mother he says little. His mind is fixed
on the empty cradle and the small fresh mound
in the churchyard, whither he goes every day.
I believe myself that it is the first time his
heart has ever been stirred by passionate love,
and now he speaks of never leaving Thorpfeld,—a
place he has been moving heaven and earth
to get away from the past six years.’</p>

<p>‘I promise you, Professor, that I’ll never
laugh at him again,’ said Gaston, very gravely.
‘There can be nothing absurd about a man who
mourns a little child like that. Give me his
address, and I’ll write to him at once.’</p>

<p>‘It may be a distraction for him, and at any
rate it will serve to show him that he is remembered
in Paris,’ said Rameau, eager to comply
with the request. We thanked the Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
for his story, with some surprise at the lateness
of the hour. The door-bell rang, and the
appearance of the servant with the evening
letters arrested our departure. With a hand
extended to the sobered St. Thomas, Rameau
took the letters and glanced as he spoke at the
top envelope, deeply edged with black. ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens!</i>
a letter from poor Krowtosky,’ he exclaimed.
He broke the seal and read aloud: ‘My dear
friend, I thank you for your kind words in my
bereavement. But I am past consolation; I
am alone now; my wife is dead, and my heart
is broken.’</p>

  <h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">U<b>NTIL</b></span> the age of twenty-one, Armand Ulrich
submitted to the controlling influences around
him,—somewhat gracelessly, be it admitted.
He sat out his uncle’s long dinners, and solaced
himself by sketching on the cloth between the
courses. He showed a discontented face at his
mother’s weekly receptions in a big Parisian
hotel, and all the while his heart was out upon
the country roads and among the pleasant
fields, where the children played under poplars
and dabbled on the brim of reedy streams. At
twenty-one, however, he regarded himself as
a free man, and threw up a situation worth
£50,000 a year or thereabouts. From this
we may infer that he was a lad full of bright
hopes and fair dreams.</p>

<p>He was the only son of a Frenchwoman of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
noble birth and of the junior partner of a
wealthy Alsatian banking-house. His taste for
strolling and camping out of doors, sketch-book
in hand and pipe in mouth, was partly an
inherited taste, with the difference that transmission
had strengthened instead of having
weakened the heritage. In earlier days Ulrich
junior had not shown an undivided spirit of
devotion to commercial interests; he had, on
the contrary, permitted himself the treasonable
luxury of gazing abroad upon many objects
not connected with the business of the firm.
Amateur theatricals had engaged his affections
in youth; five-act tragedies, in alexandrines as
long as the acts, had proved him fickle, and
operatic music had sent him fairly distraught.
He aspired to excel in all the arts, and as a fact
was successful in none.</p>

<p>When congratulated upon his brother’s versatility,
Ulrich senior would contemptuously
retort that the fellow was able to do everything
except attend to his business. As a result, he
was held in light esteem at the bank, and the
meanest client would have regarded himself
insulted if passed for consultation to this accomplished
but incompetent representative of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
firm. However agreeable his tastes may have
rendered him in society, it cannot be denied
that they were of a nature to diminish his commercial
authority. Humanity wisely draws the
line at a sonneteering banker, and looks upon
the ill-assorted marriage of account and sketch-book
with a natural distrust.</p>

<p>This state of things broke the banker’s heart.
He had a reverence for the firm of Ulrich
Brothers, and if he considered himself specially
gifted for anything, it was for the judicious
management of its affairs. Thus he lived
and died a misappreciated and misunderstood
person. To him it was a grievous injustice that
he should be treated as a man of no account,
because of a few irregular and purely decorative
accomplishments. His heart might be led
astray, he argued, but his head was untampered
with, and that, after all, is the sole organ essential
to the matter of bonds and shares. A man
may be a wise head of a family and an honest
husband, and not for that unacquainted with
lighter loves. Such trifles are but gossiping
pauses in the serious commotions and preoccupations
of life. But no amount of argument,
however logical, could blind him or others to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the fact that commercially he was a dead failure,
because a few ill-regulated impulses had occasionally
led him into idle converse with two or
three of the disreputable Nine; and mindful of
this, he solemnly exhorted his son Armand to
fix his thoughts upon the bank, and not let himself
be led astray like his misguided father by
illusive talents and disastrous tastes.</p>

<p>Armand Ulrich was a merry young fellow,
who cared not a button for all the privileges of
wealth, and looked upon an office stool with
loathing. He only wanted the free air, his
pencil, and a comfortable pipe of tobacco,—and
there he was, as he described himself, the
happiest animal in France. Before his easel he
could be serious enough, but in his uncle’s
office he felt an irresistible inclination to burst
into profane song, and make rash mention of
such places of perdition as the Red Mill and
the Shepherd Follies,—follies perfectly the
reverse of pastoral. He was not in the least
depraved, but he took his pleasure where he
found it, and made the most of it. A handsome
youngster, whom the traditional felt hat and
velvet jacket of art became a trifle too well.
At least he wore this raiment somewhat ostentatiously,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and winked a conscious eye at the
maids of earth. With such solid advantages as
a bright audacious glance, a winning smile, and
a well-turned figure, he was not backward in
his demands upon their admiration, and it must
be confessed, that men in all times have proved
destructive with less material.</p>

<p>But he was an amiable rogue, not consciously
built for evil, and he cheated the women not a
whit more than they cheated him. He knew
he was playing a game, and was fair enough to
remember that there is honour among thieves.
For the rest, he was fond of every sort of wayside
stoppages, paid his bill ungrudgingly, in
whatever coin demanded, like a gentleman, and
clinked glasses cordially with artists, strollers,
and such like vagabonds. The frock-coated
individual alone inspired him with repugnance,
and he held the trammels of respectability in
horror. Whether nature or his art were responsible
for a certain loose and merry generosity of
spirit, I cannot say; but I am of opinion that,
had his mind run to bank-books instead of
paints, though his work might be of indifferent
quality, he might have proved himself of sounder
and more sordid disposition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>Even the brightest nature finds a shadow
somewhere upon the shine, and the shade that
dimmed the sun for Armand was his mother’s
want of faith in his artistic capacities. He
loved his mother fondly, and took refuge from
her wounding scepticism in his conviction that
women, by nature and training, are unfitted to
comprehend or pronounce upon the niceties of
art. They may be perfect in all things else, but
they have not the artistic sense, and cannot
descry true talent until they have been taught
to do so. It has ever been the destiny of great
men to be undervalued upon the domestic
hearth, and ’tis a wise law of Nature to keep
them evenly balanced, and set a limit to their
inclination to assume airs. Thinking thus, he
shook off the chill of unappreciated talent, and
warmed himself back into the pleasant confidence
that was the lad’s best baggage upon
the road of life. For a moment an upbraiding
word, a cold comment upon dear lips, might
check his enthusiasm and cloud his mirthful
glance, but a whistled bar of song, a smart
stroke of pencil or brush, a glimpse of
his becoming velvet jacket in a mirror, were
enough to send hope blithely through his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
veins, and speed him carolling on the way to
fame.</p>

<p>It chanced one morning that he was interrupted
at his easel by a letter from that domestic
unbeliever who cast the sole blot upon his
artist’s sunshine. There was a certain haziness
in Armand’s relations with art. He worked
briskly enough at intervals, but he was naturally
an idler. The attitude he preferred was
that of uneager waiter upon inspiration, and he
had a notion that the longer he waited, provided
the intervals of rest were comfortably
subject to distraction, the better the inspiration
was likely to be. He had neither philosophy
nor moral qualifications to fit him for the jog-trot
of daily work. So that no interruption
ever put him out, and no intruder ever found
him other than unaffectedly glad to be intruded
upon. Such a youth would of course attack
his letters in the same spirit of hearty welcome
that he fell upon his friends.</p>

<p>But as he sat and read, his bright face
clouded, and his lips screwed and twisted themselves
into a variety of grimaces. He had a
thousand gestures and expressions at the service
of his flying moods, and before he had come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the end of his mother’s letter, not one but had
been summoned upon duty. The letter ran
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">M<b>Y</b> <b>DEAR</b> S<b>ON</b></span>,—It will, I hope, inspire you with
a little common sense to learn that your cousin
Bernard Francillon has just arrived from Vienna to
take your place at the bank. I have had a long
interview with your uncle, who makes no secret of his
intentions, should you persist in wasting your youth
and prospects in this extravagant fashion. And I
cannot blame him, for his indulgence and patience
have much exceeded my expectations. This absurd
caprice of yours has lasted too long. You are no
longer a boy, Armand, but a young man of twenty-three,
and you have no right to behave like a silly
child, who aspires to fly, instead of contentedly
riding along in the solid family coach provided for
him. If I had any confidence in your talent I might,
as you do, build my hopes upon your future fame,
and console myself for present disappointment in the
faith that your sacrifice is not in vain. But even a
mother cannot be so foolish as to believe that her son
is going to turn out a Raphael because he has donned
a velvet coat and bought a box of paints. Some
natural talent and cultivation will help any young
man to become a fair amateur, perhaps even a tenth-rate
artist; but for such it is hardly worth while to
wreck all worldly prospects. Take your father as an
example. He did all things fairly well; he drew,
painted, sang, composed, and wrote. What was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
end of it? Failure all round. He had not the
esteem of his commercial colleagues, while the artists,
in whose society he delighted, indulged his tastes as
those of an accomplished banker whose patronage
might be useful to them. While he was wrecked
upon versatility, you intend to throw away your life
upon a single illusion. Whose will be the gain?</p>

<p>Your whim has lasted two years, and you cannot
be blind to the little you have done in that time.
You have not had any success to justify further perseverance.
Then take your courage in both hands;
assure yourself that it is wiser to be a good man of
business than a bad artist; lock up your studio and
come back to your proper place. If you do so at
once, Bernard will have less chance of walking in your
shoes. He is much too often at Marly, and seems
to admire Marguerite; but I do not think a girl like
Marguerite could possibly care for such a perfumed fop.</p>

<p>When you feel the itch for vagabondage and
sketch-book, you can be off into the country, and it
need never be known that your holidays are passed
in any but the most correct fashion. As for your
uncle, he will not endure paint-boxes or pencils about
him. He is still bitter upon the remembrance of
your father’s sins in office hours. I am told he used
to draw caricatures on the blotting pads, and write
verses on the fly-leaves of the account-books. He was
much too frivolous for a banker, and I fear you have
inherited his light and unbusinesslike manners. But
be reasonable now, and come at once to your affectionate
mother,</p>


<span class="smcap right">S<b>OPHIE</b> U<b>LRICH</b></span>.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Poor Armand! The mention of Raphael in
connection with the velvet coat and paint-box
was a sore wound. It whipped the susceptible
blood into his cheeks, for though sweet-tempered,
a sneer was what he could not equably endure.
Surely his mother might have found a tenderer
way to say unpleasant things, if the performance
of this duty can ever be necessary! And bitter
to him was the assumption that his choice was
a caprice without future or justification. Having
swallowed his pill with a wry face, he was still
in the middle of a subsequent fit of indigestion,
when the door opened, and a young man in a
linen blouse cried gaily: ‘It’s a case of the early
bird on his matutinal round.’</p>

<p>‘Come in, since the worm is fool enough to
be abroad. You may make a meal of him, my
friend, and welcome, but a poor one, for he’s at
this moment the sorriest worm alive.’</p>

<p>The young man shot into the room, inelegantly
performed a step of the Red Mill to a couple of
bars of unmelodious song of a like diabolical
suggestion, and seated himself on the arm of a
chair, twisting both legs over and round the
other arm and back. In this grotesque attitude
he languidly surveyed his friend, and said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
sentimentally: ‘I have had a letter from her
this morning. She relents, my friend, in long
and flowery phrases, with much eloquence spent
upon the harshness of destiny and the cruelty
of parents. Where would happy lovers be,
Armand, if there were no destiny to rail
against and no parents to arrange unhappy
marriages?’</p>

<p>‘Nowhere, I suppose. Doubtless the parents
have the interests of the future lover in view
when they chose the unsympathetic husband,
and everything is for the best. I congratulate
you. For the moment, I am empty-handed,
and filled with a sense of the meanness of all
things; so I am in a position to give you
my undivided attention,’ said Armand dejectedly.</p>

<p>‘What’s this? I come to you, to pour the
history of my woes and joys into a sympathetic
bosom, and if you had just buried all your
near relatives you could not look more dismal.’</p>

<p>‘I should probably feel less dismal, had I
done so. But it is a serious matter when your
art is scoffed at, and you are told that you
imagine yourself a Raphael because you wear a
velvet coat and handle a brush.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En effet</i>, that is a much more serious matter,’
Maurice admitted, and at once assumed an
appropriate air of concern.</p>

<p>Armand glanced ruefully at his coat sleeve,
and began to take off the garment of obloquy
with great deliberateness.</p>

<p>‘Spare thyself, my poor Armand, even if
others spare thee not. Knowest thou not that
the coat is more than half the man? A palette
and a velvet coat have ever been wedded, and
why this needless divorce?’</p>

<p>‘I will get a blouse like yours, Maurice, and
wear it,’ said Armand, with an air of gloomy
resignation befitting the occasion.</p>

<p>‘And who has reduced you to these moral
straits, and to what deity is the coat a holocaust?’</p>

<p>For answer Armand held out his mother’s
letter, which the young man took, and read
attentively, with an expression of lugubrious
gravity. He lifted a solemn glance upon
Armand, and shook his head like a sage.</p>

<p>‘Your mother is not a flattering correspondent,
I admit. It is clear, she expected you to
justify your immoral choice by an extraordinary
start. She does not define her expectations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
’Tis a way with women. But I take it for
granted that she esteemed it your duty to cut
out Meissonnier, or by a judicious combination
of Puvis de Chavannes and Carolus Duran,
show yourself in colours of a capsizing originality,
and finally go to wreck upon a tempest of
your own making. For there is nothing in life
more unreasonable than a mother. But go to
her to-morrow, and tell her you have doffed the
obnoxious coat, and intend to live and die in
the workman’s modest blouse.’</p>

<p>‘I am not going,’ Armand protested sullenly.
‘I have made my choice, and I can’t be badgered
and worried any more about it.’</p>

<p>As behoves a poor devil living from hand to
mouth upon the problematical sale of his
pictures, Maurice Brodeau had a tremendous
respect for all that wealth implies, and like the
rest of the world, regarded Armand’s renunciation
of it as a transient caprice that by this
time ought to be on the wing. He expressed
himself with a good deal of sound sense, and
thereby evoked a burst of wrathful indignation.</p>

<p>‘Money! Money! Ah, how I hate the word,
hate still more the look of the thing! I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
watched them at the bank shovelling gold, solid
gold pieces, till my heart went sick. Where’s
the good of it? It fills the prisons, takes all
life and brightness out of humanity, builds us
iron safes, and turns us into sordid-minded
knaves. Where’s the crime that can’t be traced
to its want? and where’s the single ounce of
happiness it brings? We are dull with it,
envious without it, and yet it is only the uncorrupted
poor who really enjoy themselves and
who are really generous. The rich man counts
where the poor man spends, and which of the
two is the wiser? In God’s name, let us knock
down the brazen idol, and proclaim, without
fear of being laughed at, that there are worthier
and pleasanter objects in life, and that it is
better to watch the fair aspects of earth than to
jostle and strive with each other in its mean
pursuit. My very name is distasteful to me,
because it represents money. It is a password
across the entire world, at which all men bow
respectfully. And yet, I vow, I would sooner
wander through the squalor and wretchedness
of Saint-Ouen, any day, than find myself in the
neighbourhood of the Rue de Grenelle. There
may be other houses in that long street, but for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
me it simply means the bank. So I feel upon
sight of my mother’s hotel. Her idle and overfed
servants irritate me. Everything about her
brings the air of the bank about my nostrils,
and I only escape it here, where, thank God, I
have not got a single expensive object. I
smoke cheap cigarettes, which my poorest
friends can buy. I drink beer, and sit on
common chairs. Well, these are my luxuries,
and I take pride in the fact that there is very
little gold about me. I can sign a cheque for
a friend in need, whenever he asks me, and
that’s all the pleasure I care to extract from
the legacy of my name. For the rest, I
would forget that I have sixpence more than
is necessary for independence.’</p>

<p>A youth of such moral perversity was not to
be driven down the cotton-spinner’s path, you
perceive, and Maurice, with the tact and discretion
of his race, forbore further argument,
and contented himself with a silent shrug.</p>

<p>But Madame Ulrich was not so discreet. She
was a woman of determination, moreover, and
knew something of her son’s temperament. If
in her strife with what Armand gloriously
called his mistress she had been worsted, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
was shown by the boy’s sulky silence, she could
enlist in her service a weapon of whose terrible
power she had no doubt. A man may sulk in
the presence of his mother, but unless he has
betaken himself to the woods in the mood of a
Timon, he cannot sulk in the presence of a
beautiful young woman, who comes to him upon
sweet cousinly intent.</p>

<p>At least Armand could not, and he had too
much sense to make an effort to do so. On the
whole, he was rather proud of his weakness as
an inflammable and soft-hearted youth. He
saw the fair vision, behind his mother’s larger
proportions, for the first time in his studio, and
made a capitulating grimace for the benefit
of his friend, who was staring at the biggest
heiress of Europe with all his might, amazed
to find her such a simple-looking and inexpensively
arrayed young creature. Maurice had
perhaps an indistinct notion that the daughters
of millionaires traversed life somewhat overweighted
by the magnificence of their dress,
bonneted as no ordinary girl could be, and
habited accordingly.</p>

<p>‘One sees thousands of women dressed like
her,’ he thought to himself, after a quick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
appraising glance at her gown and hat. ‘A
hundred francs, I believe, would cover the cost.
But there is this about a lady,’ he added, as an
after reflection, while his eyes eagerly followed
her movements and gestures, the flow of her
garments and the lines of her neck and back;
‘simplicity is her crown. There is no use for
the other sort to try it; they can’t succeed, and
we know them. If Armand does not follow that
girl to bank or battle, he’s an unmannerly ass.’</p>

<p>It was not in Armand to meet unsmilingly
the arch glance of a smiling girl, even if there
were not beauty in her to prick his senses and
hold him thrilled. Forgetful of the unwelcome
fact that she was worth more than her weight
in solid gold, he melted at the sound of her
voice, and his foolish heart went out to her upon
the touch of her gloved fingers. Not as a lover
certainly, for was she not the desired of all
unmarried Europe? There was not a titled
or moneyed bride-hunter upon the face of the
civilised world with whom he had not heard
her name coupled, while he was ignorant of the
fact that the great man, her father, had destined
him to complete her, until he bolted in pursuit
of fortune on his own account.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>It flattered him to see that she had captivated
his friend, too, not contemptuous of the prospect
of exciting a little envy in the breast of that
individual; and he shot him a look of radiant
gratitude when he saw him bent upon engaging
the attention of Madame Ulrich, who was nothing
loth to be so caught. She smiled sadly,
as Maurice chattered on in high praise of her
son’s genius, and quoted the opinion of their
common master in evidence of his own discernment.
From time to time she cast a hopeful
eye upon the cousins, and mentally thanked
Marguerite for her delicate tact and rare wisdom.</p>

<p>Not a word of comment or surprise upon the
bareness of the studio or the shabbiness of the
single-cushioned chair upon which she sat; no
allusion to his sacrifice, or wonder at it. The
charming girl seemed to take it for granted
that a lad of talent should find the atmosphere
of commerce irksome, and gallantly admitted
that such a choice would have been hers, had
she been born a boy. To wander about the
world with a knapsack, and eat in dear little
cheap inns with rough peasants; to wear a silk
kerchief and no collar, and have plenty of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
pockets filled with cord and penknives, and
matches, and tobacco, and pencils, and pocketbooks;
to sleep under the stars, and bear a
wetting bravely,—this is the sort of thing she
vowed she would have enjoyed, did petticoats
and sex and other contrarieties not form an
impediment.</p>

<p>Such pretty babble might not be intended
to play into her elders’ hands, Madame Ulrich
perhaps thought, but it was very wise play for
that susceptible organ, a young man’s heart,
whether conscious or not. And that once
gained, one need never despair of the reversal
of all his idols for love.</p>

<p>When they left the studio, Armand stood
looking after them, with his hands in his
pockets, under his linen blouse, plunged in profound
meditation, the nature of which he revealed
soon to his friend.</p>

<p>‘And to think there goes the biggest prey
male rascal ever sighed for, Maurice. What
title do you imagine will buy her? Prince or
duke, for marquis is surely below the mark.
Think of it, my friend. There is hardly a wish
of hers that money cannot gratify, unless it be
a throne or a cottage. And the throne itself is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
easier come by for such as she than the cottage.
What an existence! What a dismal future!
What lassitude! What hunger, by and by, for
dry bread and cheese and common pewter! A
more nauseous destiny must it be, that of the
richest woman in the world than even that of
the richest man. At least a man can smoke a
clay pipe, and take to drink, or the road to the
devil in any other way. But what is there left
a woman whose wedding trousseau will contain
pocket-handkerchiefs that cost a hundred
pounds apiece! My aunt Mrs. Francillon’s
handkerchiefs cost that. Mighty powers! what
an awful way these charming and futile young
creatures are brought up! And you see for yourself,
this girl is no mere fashionable fool. She,
too, would have sacrificed the title and the
handkerchiefs, if it were not for the restrictions
with which she has been hedged from birth.
Let us bless our stars, Maurice, that we were
not born girls, and equally bless our stars that
girls are born for us.’</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="ARMANDS_MISTAKE_II">II</h3>
</div>

<p>Madame Ulrich and her niece came again
to the studio. They came very often. Armand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
began by counting the days between their
visits, and ended in such a state of lyrical madness
that Romeo was sobriety itself alongside
of him. In anticipation of the sequel, Maurice
supported the trial of his morning, midday, and
evening confidences with a patience deserving
the envy of angels. And not a thought of commiseration
had the raving young madman for
him, and only sometimes remembered, at the
top of his laudatory bent, to break off with
courteous regret for the unoccupied state of his
friend’s heart.</p>

<p>‘I wish to God you were married to her,’ said
Maurice one day, and Armand naturally trusted
the prayer would be heard at no distant period.</p>

<p>It was the hour of Marguerite’s visit. To
see the charming girl seated in the shabby arm-chair
he had bought at a sale in the Hôtel
Drouot, so perfectly at home, and so naïvely
pleased with little inexpensive surprises, such
as a bunch of flowers in a common jar, an
improvised tea made over their daily spirit-lamp,
much the worse for constant use; to see
her so vividly interested in the everyday life
of a couple of Bohemians, the cost of their
marketings, their bargains, and the varieties of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
their meals, their cheap amusements, unspoiled
by dress-suit or crush hat, and eager over that
chapter of their distractions that may safely be
recounted to a well-bred maiden. Armand had
never known any pleasure in his life so full of
freshness and untainted delight. Bitterly then
did he regret that there should be episodes upon
which a veil must be dropped. These, I suppose,
are regrets common to most honest young fellows
for the first time in love. He would have liked
to be able to tell her everything, not even omitting
his sins; as she sat there, and listened to him
with an air so divinely confiding and credulous.
He had a wild notion that he might be purified
from past follies, and not a few dark scenes he
dared not remember in her presence, if he might
kneel and drop his humbled head in her lap,
and feel the touch of her white hands as a
benediction and an absolution upon his forehead.
He was full of all sorts of romantic and
sentimental ideas about her, little dreaming that
the clock of fate was so close upon the midnight
chimes of hope, and that the curtain was so
soon to drop upon this pleasant pastoral played
to city sounds.</p>

<p>One day his mother came alone. One glance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
took in the blank disappointment of his expression
and all its meaning. She scrutinised
him sharply, and found the ground well prepared
for the words of wisdom she had come to sow.
She spoke of Marguerite, and the troubled youth
drank in the sound of her voice with avidity.
Did he love his cousin? How could he tell?
He knew nothing but that he lived upon her
presence; that the thought of her filled the
studio in her absence; that he dwelt incessantly
upon the memory of her words and looks and
gestures. This he supposed was love, only he
wished the word were fresher. It was applied
to the feeling inspired by ordinary girls, whereas
she was above humanity, and he was quite
ready to die for one kiss of her lips.</p>

<p>When the blank verse subsided, Madame
Ulrich bespoke the commonplace adventure of
marriage, and made mention of two serious
rivals, an English marquis and his cousin Bernard
Francillon. The mention of the marquis
he endured, and sighed; but his cousin’s name
stung his blood like a venomous bite, he could
not tell why. His brain was on fire, and he
sat with his head in his hands in great perplexity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>It was the hour of solemn choice; the
renunciation of his liberty and pleasant
vagabondage, or the hugging in private for
evermore of a sweet dream that would make
a symphonious accompaniment to his march
upon the road of life. Could the flavour of
his love survive the vulgarity of wealth, of
newspaper-paragraphs, wedding-presents, insincere
congratulations, a honeymoon enjoyed
under the stare of the gazing multitude, the
dust of social receptions, dinners, and all the
ugly routine he had flown from? On the other
hand, could he ask a daintily reared girl, like
his cousin, to tramp the country roads and
fields with him, to wander comfortless from
wayside inn to hamlet, and back to an ill-furnished
studio, at the mercy of the seasons,
and with no other luxuries than kisses, which
for him, he imagined, would ever hold the
rapture and forgetfulness of the first one?
The choice meant the clipping of his own
wings, and perhaps moral death; for her, ultimate
misery, or the tempered loveliness of a
dream preserved, and substantial bliss rejected.</p>

<p>He could not make up his mind that day,
and sent his mother away without an answer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Maurice Brodeau was not informed of his
dilemma. It was matter too delicate in this
stage for discussion. But the night brought
him no nearer to decision, and standing before
his easel, making believe to be engaged upon
a sketch he had lately taken at Fontainebleau,
he held serious debate within himself whether
he ought to consult his friend or not.</p>

<p>In his studio upstairs, Maurice was loitering
near the window in an idle mood, and saw a
quiet brougham stop in front of their house in
the Avenue Victor Hugo. He watched the
slow descent of an old man dressed in a shabby
frock-coat, untidily cravated, who leaned heavily
upon a thick-headed cane. The old gentleman
surveyed the green gate on which were nailed
the visiting-cards of the two artists, and jerked
up a sharp pugnacious chin.</p>

<p>‘Our ancient uncle, the respectable and
mighty banker, of a surety,’ laughed Maurice,
on fire for the explanation of the riddle.</p>

<p>The head of the firm of Ulrich pushed open
the gate, sniffed the air of the damp courtyard,
and solemnly mounted the wooden stairs, making
a kind of judicial thud with his heavy
stick.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>‘The jackanapes!’ he muttered, for the benefit
of a tame cat. ‘It is a miracle how these
young fools escape typhoid fever, living in such
places.’</p>

<p>Maurice cautiously peeped over the banisters,
and saw the old gentleman turn the handle of
Armand’s door without troubling to knock.
‘Good Lord!’ thought the watcher, ‘it is fortunate
friend Armand has broken with that
little devil Yvette, or the old bear might have
had the chance of putting a fine spoke in his
wheel with cousin Marguerite.’</p>

<p>Armand in his linen blouse was standing in
front of his easel, with his back to the door.
He was certainly working, but his mind was
not so fixed upon his labour but that he had
more than an odd thought for his cousin.
Pretty phrases, gestures, and expressions of
hers kept running through his thoughts, as an
under-melody sometimes runs through a piece
of music, unaggressively but soothingly claiming
the ear. They brought her presence about
him, to cheer him in the midst of his solemn
preoccupations upon their mutual destiny.
While his reason said no, and he regarded
himself as a fine fellow for listening to reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
at such a moment, her lips curved and smiled
and bent to his in imagination’s first spontaneous
kiss. And then he told himself pretty
emphatically that he was growing too sentimental,
and that it behoves a man to take his
pleasure and his pains heartily and bravely,
and not go abroad whimpering for the moon.
Just when he had made up his mind to shoulder
his moral baggage and, whistling merrily, face
the solitary roads, he was made to jump and
fall back into perplexity by a crusty, well-known
voice.</p>

<p>‘Well, young man! So this is where you
waste your time?’</p>

<p>Armand swung round in great alarm, and
reddened painfully.</p>

<p>‘You look astounded, and no wonder. ’Tis
an honour I don’t often pay young idiots like
you. Ouf, man! Look at his dirty jacket.
Your father was a rock of sense in comparison.
At least, he did not get himself up like a baker’s
boy, and go roystering in company with a band
of worthless rascals.’</p>

<p>‘I presume, uncle, you have come here for
something else besides the pleasure of abusing
my father to me.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>‘There he is now, off in a rage. Can’t you
keep cool for five minutes, you hot-headed
young knave? What concern is it of mine if
you choose to die in the workhouse? But
there’s your mother. It frets her, and I esteem
your mother, young sir.’</p>

<p>Armand lifted his brows discontentedly. He
held his tongue, for there was nothing to be said,
as he had long ago beaten the weary ground of
protest and explanation.</p>

<p>‘The rascal says nothing, thinks himself a
great fellow, I’ve no doubt. The Almighty
made nothing more contrary and mischievous
than boys. They have you by the ears when
you want to sit comfortably by your fireside.
Finds he’s got a heart too, I hear. Mayhap
that will sober him, though I’m doubtful.’</p>

<p>Armand stared, and changed colour like a
girl. He eyed his uncle apprehensively, and
began to fiddle with his brushes. ‘I—I don’t
understand you, sir,’ he said tentatively.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you do, but you think it well to play
discretion with me. I’m the girl’s father, and
there’s no knowing how I may take it, eh, you
young villain?’</p>

<p>The old man pulled his nephew’s ear, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
laughed in a low chuckling way peculiar to
crusty old gentlemen.</p>

<p>‘Has my mother spoken to you about,—about——?’</p>

<p>‘Suppose she hasn’t, eh? What then?’</p>

<p>‘I am completely in the dark,’ Armand
gasped. ‘How could you guess such a thing,
uncle?’</p>

<p>‘Suppose I haven’t guessed it either, eh?
What then?’</p>

<p>Armand’s look was clearly an interrogation,
almost a prayer. He blinked his lids at the
vivid flash of conjecture, and shook his head
dejectedly against it. ‘You can’t mean—no, it
cannot be that——’</p>

<p>The old man waggled a very sagacious
head.</p>

<p>‘Marguerite!’ shouted the astounded youth,
and there was a feeling of suffocation about his
throat.</p>

<p>‘Suppose one foolish young person liked to
believe she had a partner in her folly, eh, young
man? What then?’</p>

<p>‘My cousin, too!’</p>

<p>‘And if it were so, eh? What then?’</p>

<p>‘Good God! uncle, why do you come and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
tell me this?’ The dazed lad began to walk
about distractedly, and was not quite sure that
it was not the room that was walking about
instead of his own legs.</p>

<p>‘I think we may burn the sticks and daubs
and brushes now, eh, young man?’ laughed the
old man, waggling his stick instead of his head
in the direction of Armand’s easel, and giving a
contented vent to his peculiar chuckle. ‘Burn
the baker’s blouse, and dress yourself like a
Christian. When you are used to the novelty
of a coat and a decent dinner, you may come
down to Marly and see that giddy-pated girl of
mine. But a week of steady work at the bank
first, and mind, no paint-boxes or dirty daubers
about the place. If I catch sight of any long-haired
fellow smelling of paint, I’ll call the
police.’</p>

<p>Armand gazed regretfully round his little
studio. He picked out each familiar object with
a sudden sense of separation and a wish to bear
them ever with him in that long farewell glance.
But the sadness was a pleasant sadness, for was
not happy love the beacon that lured him forth,
and when the heart is young what lamp shines
so radiantly and invites so winningly? Still, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
was a sacrifice, though beyond lay the prospect
of a lover’s meeting, in which the thought of
stuff so common as gold would lie buried in the
first pressure of a girl’s lips.</p>

<p>‘You are not decided, I daresay?’ sneered
his uncle.</p>

<p>Armand met his eyes unflinchingly, and held
out his hand. ‘A man who is worth the name
can’t regret love and happiness. For Marguerite’s
sake I will do my best in the new life
you offer, and I thank you, uncle, for the gift.’</p>

<p>‘That young fop from Vienna will feel mighty
crestfallen,’ was the reflection of the head of
the Ulrich Bank, as he hobbled downstairs.
He disliked the elegant Bernard, and was himself
glad to have back his favourite nephew,
though the means he had employed to secure
that result might not be of unimpeachable
honesty.</p>

<p>The banker’s departure was the signal for
Maurice, on the look-out upstairs. He bounded
down the stairs, three steps at a time, and shot
in upon the meditative youth. Armand glanced
up, and smiled luminously. ‘The besieged has
capitulated, Maurice.’</p>

<p>‘So I should think. For some time back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
you have worn the air of a man on the road to
bondage.’</p>

<p>Brodeau had never for an instant doubted
that this would be the end of it. He mildly
approved the conventional conclusion, though
not without private regrets of his own.</p>

<p>‘A girl’s eyes have done it,’ sighed Armand
sentimentally.</p>

<p>‘Of course, of course, the old temptation.
But she would have inveigled Anthony out of
his hermitage. A sorry time you’ll have of it,
I foresee, though I honestly congratulate you.
It is a thing we must come to sooner or later,
and the escapades of youth have their natural
end, like all things else. Only lovers believe in
eternity, until they have realised the fragility of
love itself. It was absurd to imagine you could
go on flouting fortune for ever, and living in a
shanty like this, with a palace ready for you
on the other side of the river. But there is
consolation for me in the thought that you will
give me a big order in commemoration of your
marriage—eh, old man?’</p>

<p>When it came to parting the young men
wrung hands with a sense of more than ordinary
separation. For two years had they shared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
fair and foul weather, and camped together out
of doors and under this shabby roof, upon which
one was now about to turn his back. The
days of merry vagabondage were at an end for
Armand, and his face was now towards civilisation
and respectable responsibilities. He might
revisit this scene of pleasant Bohemia, and find
things unchanged, but the old spirit would not
be with him, and the zest of old enjoyments
would be his no more.</p>

<p>‘Many a merry tramp we’ve had together,
Armand,’ said Maurice, and he felt an odd
sensation about his throat, while his eyelids
pricked queerly. ‘We’ve got drunk together
on devilish bad wine, and pledged ourselves
eternally to many a worthless jade. We’ve
smoked a pipe we neither of us shall forget, and
walked beneath the midnight stars in many
a curious place. And now we part, you for
gilded halls and wedding chimes, I to seek a
new comrade, and make a fresh start across the
beaten track of Bohemia.’</p>

<p>Maurice crammed his knuckles furiously
into his eyes. His eloquence had mounted
to his head, and flung him impetuously into
his friend’s arms with tears streaming down his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
cheeks. ‘You’ll come back again, won’t you,
Armand?’</p>

<p>‘Come back? Yes,’ Armand replied sadly;
‘but I shall feel something like Marius among
the ruins of Carthage.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll keep your velvet jacket, and when you
are tired of grandeur and lords and dukes, you
can drop in here and put it on, and smoke a
comfortable pipe in your old arm-chair.’</p>

<p>Maurice went straightway to the nearest café,
and spent a dismal evening, consuming bock
after bock, until he felt sufficiently stupefied to
face his solitary studio, where he shed furtive
tears in contemplation of all his friend’s property
made over to him as an artist’s legacy.</p>

<p>Though brimming over with happiness and
excitement, Armand himself was not quite free
of regret for the relinquished velvet jacket and
brushes and boxes, as he made his farewell to
wandering by a journey on the top of an omnibus
from the Étoile to the Rue de Grenelle, and
solaced himself with a cheap cigarette.</p>

<p>For one long week did he work dutifully at
the bank, inspected books with his uncle, and
repressed an inclination to yawn over the dreary
discussion of shares and bonds and funds, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
vast European projects and policies in jeopardy,
and he felt the while a smart of homesickness
for the little studio in the Avenue Victor Hugo.
In the evening he dined with his mother, and
found consolation for the irksomeness of etiquette
in the excellence of the fare. He
thought of Marguerite incessantly, and spoke
of her whenever he could, but he did not forget
Maurice or the cooking-stove, on which
their dinners in the olden days had so often
come to grief. He might sip Burgundy now,
yet he relished not the less the memory of the
big draughts of beer which he and Maurice had
found so delicious.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="ARMANDS_MISTAKE_III">III</h3>
</div>

<p>But all these pinings and idle regrets were
silenced, and gave place to rapturous content
the first afternoon on which he walked up the
long avenue of his uncle’s country house at
Marly. The week of trial was at an end, and
he was now to claim his reward from dear lips.
Everything under the sun seemed to him perfect,
and even banks had their own charm, discernible
to the happy eye. There was a beauty in gold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
he had hitherto failed to perceive, and crusty old
gentlemen were the appropriate guardians of
lovely nymphs. In such a mood, there is
melody in all things, and warmth lies even in
frosted starlight. Nothing but the sweetness
of life is felt: its turbidness and accidents, its
disappointments, pains, and stumbles, lie peacefully
forgotten in the well of memory; and
we wish somebody could have told us in some
past trouble that the future contained for us a
moment so good as this.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle is in the garden,’ a servant
informed him, and led the way through halls
and salons, down steps running from the long
window into a shaded green paradise. And then
he heard a fresh voice that he seemed not to
have heard for so long, and on hearing it only
was his heart made aware how much he had
missed it during the past age of privation.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my cousin Armand!’</p>

<p>There was a young man dawdling at her feet
in an attitude that sent the red blood to
Armand’s forehead. This was Bernard Francillon,
his other and less sympathetic cousin.
The young man jumped up, and measured
him in a stare of insolent interrogation, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Marguerite, with a look of divine self-consciousness
and a lovely blush, said, very softly: ‘So,
Armand, you have let yourself be tamed, and
you have actually forsaken your delightful den,
I hear. How could you, my cousin? The
cooking-stove, the fishing-rod, the easel, blouse,
and velvet jacket,—all abandoned for the less
interesting resources of our everyday existence!’</p>

<p>Her eyes and voice were full of arch protest,
and her smile went to the troubled lad’s head,
more captivating than wine. ‘It was for your
sake, Marguerite,’ he answered timidly, in tones
dropped to an unquiet murmur.</p>

<p>‘Permit me, cousin, to retire for the moment,’
said Bernard, turning his back deliberately
upon his disconcerted relative.</p>

<p>What was it in their exchanged looks, in
their clasped hands, in Bernard’s unconscious
air of fond proprietorship, in Marguerite’s half
droop towards him of shy surrender, that carried
to Armand the conviction of fatal error? He
watched his rival departing, and turned a blank
face upon the radiant girl, whose delicious smile
had all the eloquence and trouble of maiden’s
relinquished freedom. She met his white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
empty gaze with a glance more full and frank
than the one she had just lifted so tenderly to
Bernard Francillon. ‘I don’t understand you,
Armand. Why for my sake?’</p>

<p>‘It was your father’s error. He thought you
loved me, and I, heaven help me! till now I
thought so too,’ he breathed in a despairing
undertone, not able to remove his eyes from her
surprised and delicately concerned face.</p>

<p>‘Poor Armand! I am very sorry,’ was all
she said, but the way in which she held her
hand out to him was a mute admission of his
miserable error. He lifted the little hand to his
lips, and turned from her in silence.</p>

<p>The sun that had shone so brightly a moment
ago was blotted from the earth, and the music
of the birds was harsh discordance, as he wandered
among the evening shadows of the woods.
All things jarred upon his nerves, until night
dropped a veil upon the horrible nakedness of
his sorrow. He felt he wore it upon his face
for all eyes to see, and he thanked the darkness,
as it sped over the starry heavens. Beyond the
beautiful valley, where the river flowed, the
spires and domes and bridges of Paris showed
through the reddish glimmer of sunset as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
through a dusty light. Soon there would be
noise and laughter upon the crowded boulevards,
and a flow of carriages making for the theatres
through the flaunting gas-flames; and happy
lovers in defiant file would be driving towards
the Bois. How often had he and Maurice
watched them on foot, as they smoked their
evening cigarette, and sighed or laughed as
might be their mood. Would he ever have the
heart to laugh at lovers again, or laugh at anything,
he wondered drearily! And there was no
one here to remind him that sorrow, like joy, is
evanescent, and that all wounds are healed.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe,</i>—even pain and
broken hearts.</p>

<p>Here silence was almost palpable to the touch,
like the darkness of Nature dropping into sleep.
He turned his back upon Paris, and faced the
dim country.</p>

lifetime, or part of it, to the study of foreign
architecture. But a friend reproachfully reminded
Fred Luffington that English minsters
are worth a glance. Fred did not dispute it.
There was a certain charm in the novelty of
the idea. So he packed his portmanteau, and
took the boat to Dover, to assure himself a
pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>At York he bethought himself of an amiable
old Flemish priest, in whose company he had
studied a good deal of Antwerp at a time
when Antwerp wore for him the colours and
glory and other attendant joys of paradise.
The priest, he remembered, was settled hard
by, as the chaplain of a Catholic earl. He
would take the opportunity of studying village
life as well as the minsters of England; and
smoke a pipe of memory, and drink big draughts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
of the beer of other days, with his friend, the
Flemish priest.</p>

<p>Fendon was as comfortable a little village
as any to be dreamed of out of Arcadia. Its
warm red roofs made a cosy circle under the
queerest of rural walls, round a delightful green.
A real green, a goose common, with an umbrella
tree in the middle, and a village pump under
an odd grey dome of stone supported by rough
pillars. All the houses were buried in trees,
and all the palings overgrown with honeysuckles.</p>

<p>Fred Luffington sniffed delightedly. Though
it was June, there was plenty of damp in the
air, and lovely moist smells came from the
hedges and fields. Yes; this was enchantment,
a whiff of pure sixteenth century, the very
thing described by old-fashioned writers as
‘Merrie England.’ It did not look very merry,
to be sure; rather sleepy and still. But it was
not difficult to swing back upon imagination
into the days of Good Queen Bess.</p>

<p>Fred’s glance grew vague, and the lyrical
mood was upon him. He mused upon may-poles,
foaming tankards, and the rosy maids
and swains of the centuries when there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
‘love in a village.’ There were no rosy maids
or sighing swains about, but he imagined them
along with the rest of Elizabethan decorations,
evoked confusedly by remembrance of past
readings.</p>

<p>Everything combined to keep him in good
humour. The name of his inn, the only inn,
was ‘St. George and the Dragon.’ Who but a
scoffer or a heathen could fail to sleep well at
an inn so gloriously named? As an archæologist,
Fred was neither, so naturally he slept
the sound sleep of the believer, somebody
infinitely superior to the merely just man.
Anybody may be just, but it takes a special
constitution to believe, in the proper manner.
Fred Luffington was all that is most special in
the way of constitutions, so after a charmed
inspection of the sign-board—a rude picture of
the saint in faded colours on a semi-effaced
horse with a remarkable dragon at his feet—he
sauntered in through the porch to be confronted
with a perfectly ideal buxom landlady. This
was more than heaven, he devoutly felt, and
said his prayers on the spot to the god of chance,
who so benevolently watches over the humours
of romantic young men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Matcham, spick and span and respectable,
beamed him welcome of a mediæval
cordiality. He felt at once it was good to be
with her, and took shame to himself for having
been so long enamoured of foreign parts, and
unacquainted with the pleasant aspects of
English country life. She deposited his bag
on a table at the bottom of a red-curtained
four-poster, and remarked that she was granting
him the privilege of occupying the room
of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy. There was such a
full accompaniment of condescension and favour
in her smile, and so complete a signification
of the importance and fame of Mr. Malcolm
Fitzroy, that Luffington felt abashed by his
own ignorance of the personality of the local
great man, and kept a discreet silence.</p>

<p>When he descended to the dining-room, his
delightful landlady, entering with the tray,
paused in critical survey of the table.</p>

<p>‘I have placed your seat before the fireplace,
sir. Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy always prefers it so.
But perhaps you would like to sit in front of
the window.’</p>

<p>Luffington seized the fact that any taste but
that of the mysterious great man’s would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
evidence of inferiority. But it was necessary
to make a stand for originality. The expected
docility fired revolt in his veins. At the price
of consideration, he decided for the window
in front, instead of the fireplace behind. The
pleasures and pangs of our life depend upon
little things, and the little thing in question
gave a silly satisfaction to Luffington, and
disproportionately pained the good landlady.</p>

<p>After his late lunch, Luffington strolled forth
to pick up rural sensations on his way to the
Flemish priest’s. He encountered glances of
dull interest, but nowhere the rosy village maid
and her pursuant swain that his studies in
pastoral literature had taught him to expect
as the obvious decoration of a quiet rustic
scene.</p>

<p>‘There is nothing so misleading as literature,
unless, perhaps, history,’ he observed, in a fond
retrospect of the centuries. ‘The disappointments
of the present build for us the illusions
of the future,’ he added incoherently.</p>

<p>The Flemish priest was tending his bees,
with a thick blue veil tied over his felt hat, when
he heard the garden gate swing upon its hinges.
He looked up and saw an elegant young man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
pointing, as he came along, a meditative cane
in the neighbourhood of his dearest treasures,
a row of white and blue irises.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Santa Purissima!</i> Can these sons of perdition
not learn to keep their shticks and their
long limbs from ze borders if they must invade
our gardens?’</p>

<p>He slipped off his veil and showed a fat yellow
face streaked with the red of anger. Luffington
held out his hand, laughing.</p>

<p>‘By all that’s holy! My young friend of
Antwerp. Welcome, welcome! Ah, my boy!
how many, six, eight years ago! What a lad
you were then with your dreams of love and
fame! And how have they fared, those dreams—eh?
Gone ahead, or dropped behind, as ’tis
the way with young dreams? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein!</i>’</p>

<p>Luffington nodded sentimentally, like one
rocked upon sudden waves of regret. The
dreams had dropped behind with the years,
and it was an effort to recall them to vivider
shape than a cloud with a sunny ray upon it.</p>

<p>‘Have you any of the old tobacco?’ he asked.
‘A pipe might lead us over the forgotten ground
again, and revive the dead persons of that little
Antwerp drama. You’ve added bees to botany,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
I see. Could you get up a massacre of the
drones while I am here? I’ve never been able
to put full faith in all the astounding stories we
have of the bees, and might be converted by a
practical demonstration.’</p>

<p>‘Come along inside, and leave my bees alone,
you insolent sceptic of the world. That’s your
French air—the very worst to breathe. I suppose
you take brandy and mud in your literature,
too. I heard you talk of Dumas once, and
thought it bad, but now, of course, you’re down
with the naturalists, the symbolists, and the
philosophers of insanity.’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit. I haven’t got beyond dear old
Dumas, where you left me. And here I am,
anchored momentarily in Arcadia, among the
bees and the flowers, under the protection of
St. George, with a mighty minster near at
hand.’</p>

<p>Under the congenial influences of Pilsener
and a certain French tobacco affected by the
pair, they sat in a book-lined study and talked
of many things. It was only at table, later,
that Luffington, over his soup, remembered to
mention the name of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy.</p>

<p>‘An old friend of the family,’ the priest explained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
meaning the earl and his wife. Upon
the Harborough estates there could, of course,
be only one family in all conversation.</p>

<p>The priest walked back to the inn with
Luffington, and accepted a glass of rum punch
from the hand of Mrs. Matcham.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy always says that nobody
can make rum punch like me,’ she
remarked, not without the hue of modesty upon
her cheek at sounding her own praises; and
her glance sparkled to Luffington’s upon his
acknowledgment of the truth.</p>

<p>‘There are drawbacks to a sojourn upon the
vacant hearth of a god,’ he said, when the door
closed upon her exit. ‘His worshippers are
invidiously reminiscent, and you court unfavourable
comparison whether you sit, sleep,
eat, or drink.’</p>

<p>But the punch was good, the bed excellent,
the quiet conducive to dreamless sleep. Luffington
was abroad early next morning, indifferent
to the thought of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy, as he
sipped the dew with a shower of song in his
face, and the light at his feet ran along the
grass and through the trees in dimpled
rivers of gold. The priest had told him that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the earl loved his trees like children. Fred
did not wonder, as he hailed them ‘magnificent,’
and went his way among them in full-eyed
admiration.</p>

<p>It was a placid, even scene, such as one dwells
on in loving memory when homesick in far-off
lands. Lordly oaks and beeches and sentimental
firs beshadowed the well-trimmed lawny
spaces. The air played freely round and about
them, and the light was broad and soft. If you
stepped aside from the lawn and level avenues,
you might lose yourself in the pleasant woods,
alive with the chatter of birds, in the midst of
fragrance and gloom. Water was not absent,
and if you crossed the deer-park, you could
follow its lazy way to Fort Mary, where the
earl had a summer residence, aptly named by
the French governess, ‘Le Petit Trianon.’
Luffington liked the notion. It was all so
artificial, so costly, so preposterously pastoral,
that his mind willingly went back to Versailles,
and the musked and scarlet-heeled century.
The ground was green velvet, unrelieved by
as much as a daisy. It demanded Watteau
robes, and periwigged phrases and piping
strains of Lulli and Rameau. The boats were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
toys upon an artificial lake, and it was like
hearing of children’s games to learn of regattas
held here every summer. The idea of a
Venetian fête was more appropriate to celebrate
the birth of the heir, and lords and ladies
in rich Elizabethan disguises grouped upon the
velvet sward, upon the balcony of the ‘Trianon,’
or making pictures of glitter and sharp shadow
upon the breast of dark water in the gleam of
variously coloured lamps.</p>

<p>Luffington stopped to chat with a loutish
fellow who was rolling the ground down to the
minute pier, and chopping off the heads of the
innocent daisies, along his path.</p>

<p>‘The notion of improvement is inseparably
wedded to that of destruction,’ Fred mused, as
he placidly surveyed the process, and dived his
stick among the layers of massacred innocents.
The thought opened his lips, but the lout lent
an uncomprehending ear to his speech, shook
his head as at obvious eccentricity of reflection,
and rolled on with his look of gross stupidity.
This proceeding disconcerted the traveller, who
wanted to talk, and imbibe at the founts of
rustic wit. He glanced around, and spied a
little boat swaying among the rushes. Could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
he use it? The lout looked up sideways, wiped
his mouth with the back of his hand, and
offered his daughter as ferryman. At that
moment Fred heard a thin unmusical sound,
like that of a string drawn flat:</p>

<p class="center">
‘Friends, I’ve lost my own true lover,<br >
Tra la la la la la la.’<br >
</p>

<p>Through a clump of noble trees a little maid
approached, not more beautiful to the eye than
was her flat, tuneless voice to the ear. She
assented without any eagerness to row him
across the lake, and had nothing more interesting
to communicate than that Mr. Malcolm
Fitzroy was very fond of Fort Mary.</p>

<p>‘Decidedly I must see this fellow if I have to
wait a month,’ thought Fred, with a pardonable
feeling of irritation.</p>

<p>On his way back, he hailed his friend among
the flowers and bees, and stood leaning over the
gate to acquaint him with his intention to start
at once upon exploration of the neighbourhood.
The Flemish priest stood in the blaze of sunshine,
and mopped his forehead repeatedly
before urging him to wait another day, when he
would be able to offer the advantage of his own
trap and himself as guide.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>‘I can’t go to-day,’ he said, with an air of importance.
‘Her ladyship has appointed this
afternoon to come and consult with me about
the schools.’</p>

<p>It was evident to Mr. Luffington, as he went
off in search of lunch, that after Mr. Malcolm
Fitzroy, the Countess of Harborough was the
figure of importance. The defection of his
friend and the absence of romance among the
villagers turned him to misanthropy, and as,
late in the afternoon, fatigued after a long walk
through the woods, he entered the inn porch, he
told himself emphatically that he would leave
Fendon on his way to the cathedral, and thence
return to London.</p>

<p>He found the inn in a state of unwonted
flurry, which was explained to him by a telegram
announcing the arrival of Mr. Malcolm
Fitzroy upon the last train.</p>

<p>‘And I’ve the great man’s room,’ said Fred
to himself, laughing, as he set out for the priest’s
cottage.</p>

<p>The dinner was good, the wine not execrable,
the tobacco best of all; and in excellent spirits,
quite restored to his belief in men and women,
Fred started off alone for ‘St. George and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Dragon,’ under a suspicion of moonlight just
enough to send a quiver of silver through the
trees, and show the darkness of the road, but
not enough to send reason distraught down
sentimental byways and insistently urge the
advantages of open air meditation. He reached
his inn sane and safe, and bethought himself of
unanswered letters. Suddenly he was disturbed
in the glow of composition by the sound of
swift steps on the stairs and the ring of violent,
angry speech.</p>

<p>‘A stranger in my room, Mrs. Matcham!
Tut, tut. This is what I cannot permit. Instantly
order him to clear out.’</p>

<p>Luffington looked up inquiringly as the door
opened with an aggressive bang, and a queer
attractive-looking fellow stood eyeing him imperiously
upon the threshold. He had imagined
Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy a respectable English
gentleman, florid, prosperous, eminently aristocratic.
He was confronted with the reverse.
Before him stood in a threatening attitude, and
frowning hideously, a man almost too dark for
English blood, too small and too vengefully
passionate of feature and expression. His hair,
which curled, was of a dusty black, as if it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
lain in ashes. His lips were full and red, covered
with the same dust-hued shadow, and teeth
so white, nostrils so fine and sharp, brows so low
and oddly beautiful, surely never belonged to
the respectable English race. His eyes were
long, of a liquid blackness, through which red
and yellow flames leaped as in those of an untamed
animal, and his hands were brown and
small, like the hands of a slender girl.</p>

<p>‘Do you hear, sir? This is my room,’ he
cried.</p>

<p>There was a foreign richness in his voice that
matched the quaint exterior, and was equally in
puzzling contrast with his pretensions as an
Englishman.... Luffington was convinced he
had to do with some adventurer over seas,
and he curtly replied that for the present the
room was his. Mrs. Matcham, scared and
anxious, shot him a glance of prayer over the
shoulder of her domineering customer.</p>

<p>But Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy was not to be
silenced or turned out by the superior airs of a
strolling jackanapes. He paced the room in
his quick, light way, opened familiar drawers
and presses, inquired after missing objects, and
never stopped in a running murmur upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
impudence of travellers and the insolence of
intruders.</p>

<p>‘May I point out that you are condemning
yourself?’ Luffington dryly remarked, as he
watched him in wonder. ‘Intrusion can never
be other than insolent.’</p>

<p>‘Then why the devil are you sitting here,
sir?’</p>

<p>‘For the simple reason that I slept here last
night, and the room is mine as long as I stay
at this inn.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Matcham, you had no business to let
this chamber when there are others unoccupied
in the house. You know I am liable to turn up
at any moment, and that I cannot sleep in any
room but this.’</p>

<p>There was something so boyish in the tone
of complaint, that Luffington insensibly softened
to the odd and ill-mannered creature, and
smiled broadly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Matcham was affirming the comforts of
a back room, when he stopped her shortly with
a protest that this was information for Mr.
Fitzroy, whom the matter concerned.</p>

<p>‘I tell you, sir, I will not give up my room,’
shouted Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Luffington shrugged, and made a feint of resuming
his writing, upon which Mr. Fitzroy
plumped down into an arm-chair, crossed his
slim legs savagely, and ordered the landlady to
bring in his carpet bag, and produce glasses
and two bottles of his special port. Luffington
said nothing, but smiled as he continued to
write, and took a sidelong view of his strange
enemy. The more he looked, the more he
wondered at the singular prestige of such a
person in a place like Fendon. He had not
the appearance of a gentleman, was the reverse
of imposing, and according to the Flemish
priest, was ‘just one of the poorest dogs in
Christendom.’</p>

<p>‘He pays Mrs. Matcham thirty shillings a
week, and nobody else anything, and he travels
third class like myself,’ the priest added, but
Luffington thought that his air was that of a
man who holds back something.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy, as if he
were pointing a cocked pistol at an antagonist,
‘you have an opportunity of assuring yourself
that there is good port to be had in at least one
inn in Great Britain.’</p>

<p>‘I am ready to accept the fact upon your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
statement, but I am no judge of port. It’s a
wine I never drink.’</p>

<p>‘Claret, I suppose? Abominable trash, but
there’s good stuff of that sort too, eh, Mrs.
Matcham? Two bottles of one of their castles—Lafitte,
La rose—something in that way.’</p>

<p>He yapped out his words like the spoken
barks of an angry terrier, and poured himself
out a glass of Harborough port, which he fondly
surveyed, then tasted with a beatific nod.</p>

<p>‘Nowhere to be had out of England. Bloodless
foreigners go to the deuce on their clarets.
They’d be content to sit at home, and let their
neighbours’ wives alone if they drank port. But
then you have to go to an earl’s cellar for anything
like this.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly,’ said Fred Luffington, now restored
to good humour, and very much amused by his
extraordinary companion. ‘But as we all
haven’t a key to such cellars, it is safer to stick
to the harmless grape-juice than court gout with
doctored port. I’m for the foreigners myself,
whatever their domestic sins may be. Port is
as heavy as your climate, your women, your
literature.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Matcham, partly reassured, entered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
two bottles and one of those hideous green
glasses described as claret glasses. This she
placed in front of Mr. Luffington, and taking a
bottle from her hand, Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy
filled the unsightly chalice. Luffington drank
his wine appreciatively, pronounced it rare, and
wandered off upon the exciting topic of vintages.
He no longer wondered at the prestige
of a man who could command such claret.</p>

<p>‘You’re a Londoner, I suppose—an impudent
Cockney?’ said Mr. Fitzroy, observing him
as he put aside the green glass and stretched
behind for his toilet tumbler. ‘Right you are
there, my friend. One of the pleasures of good
wine is to watch the play of light in its depths
of colour. It passes my imagination how such
complacent ugliness as this came to be manufactured.’
He took the glass in his fingers,
stared at it, shook his head and flung it into
the grate.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Matcham may object to such summary
justice,’ laughed Luffington.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Matcham object to any act of mine,
sir? That would be a revolution. I’ve only
to say the word, and both Mrs. Matcham and
John Graham are ready to take you by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
scruff of the neck and plant you in the middle
of the common.’</p>

<p>‘Instead, we sit pledging each other in the
best of wines, and your antecedent ill-humour is,
I hope, carried off, once you have named a continental
Englishman, ‘Impudent Cockney’.’</p>

<p>Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy’s sombre eyes were
instantly shot with mirth. He smiled delightfully,
and as he did so, looked less and less of
a Briton. It was the lovely roguish smile of a
child that flashed from wreathed lips and ran
up like light to the broad brows arched expressively.
You would have forgiven him murder
on the spot, much less a rude speech. He
dipped into his glass, and sipped vigour therefrom
for a fresh onslaught.</p>

<p>‘Ah, the continent! Generally means
France, and France, of course, means Paris, and
Paris, by God, means every devilry under the
sun. Barricades, Bastilles, Julys, Septembers,
baggy red breeches, Cockades, Marseillaises,
Communism, Atheism, in a word, hell’s own
mischief.’</p>

<p>‘I commend your mental repertory, sir. It
is a neat historical survey extending over the
past hundred years. We will say nothing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
its justice. When our aim is the saying of much
in little, we must be content to dispense with
justice. But at least permit me to remark that
Paris does not mean the continent for me—very
much the reverse.’</p>

<p>‘Then you ought to have sense enough to be
drinking port instead of one of your washy
French castles,’ roared Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy,
attacking his second bottle after he had thrust
Fred’s second under his nose.</p>

<p>The night wore on, and the two men gradually
grew to view one another through the
rosiest glamour. Luffington was ready to
swear that his companion was the most entertaining
he had ever encountered, and Mr.
Malcolm Fitzroy, as he subsided into sleep
upon his friend’s sofa, knew not whether he was
most satisfied in having gained his point about
the room—albeit Luffington enjoyed the bed—or
in having made the acquaintance of such a
remarkably agreeable young fellow—no nonsense,
no cockloftiness, no French Atheism, or
any other perverse ’isms for that matter, he
murmured as he wandered into the devious
country of dreams.</p>

<p>Early next morning Luffington walked down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
to the priest’s cottage, to describe the night’s
adventures to his friend. They paced the
garden pathway, Fred puffing a cigar, and both
were enjoying a hearty laugh over the story,
when two figures stood upon the bright edge
of meadow that led into the deer-park. Clear
and unshadowed in the morning sunshine, it
was as pleasant a picture as the eye of man
could desire, and to Fred, after his travels, all
the pleasanter for being so distinctly English. A
fair, handsome lady, in a light tweed dress, a
broad-brimmed hat tied under her chin with
long blue ribbons; from her arm swung a long-legged
child, short-skirted, with an Irish red
cloak blown out from her shoulders, upon the
swell of which her long bright hair flowed like
a sunny streamer. The child was looking up
with an urgent charming expression, and talking
with extreme vivacity. The lady smiled down
upon her, tapped her cheek, and carried her
along at a quick pace toward the cottage.</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship and her stepdaughter,’ said the
priest. ‘It’s beautiful to see how they love one
another. If all mothers were like that stepmother!
But the wisest of us talk a deal of
nonsense about women. Isn’t she handsome?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Luffington admitted that she was, in the
strictly English way—somewhat empty and
expressionless, and feared that forty would find
her fat.</p>

<p>The countess stopped at the gate, and chatted
most affably. She gave the priest a commission
that postponed their projected excursion till
mid-day, and kindly invited Luffington to look
over the Hall at his leisure. The little girl
offered to show him her collection of butterflies,
and then skipped away, with her blonde hair
and red cloak blown out sideway like a sail.</p>

<p>‘Has the Countess of Harborough no children
of her own?’ asked Luffington.</p>

<p>‘No; Lady Alice is the earl’s only child, and
both he and the countess adore her.’</p>

<p>The postponement of their excursion drove
Luffington alone into the solitary woods. But
solitude among trees had no terrors for him;
enchantment sat upon his errant mind as fancy
led him over dappled sward and under the
foliaged arches of mossy aisles. He came upon
a bridge, under which a slant of water chattered
its foamy way over large stones, and fell into
sedate and scarce audible ripples between green
banks and a thick line of shrubs. The outer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
bank he followed in a pastoral dream, to the
accompaniment of a pretty consort of bird-song
and babbling stream. He discovered that it
led straight to Fort Mary, and here he sat on
the edge of the pier, dangling his legs over the
lake, as he smoked and forgot the hours.</p>

<p>The ‘Trianon’ lay behind, and as he lifted a
leg, and sprang upon the gravel, he was conscious
of the sound of a stifled sob carried,
he believed, from the trees edging the sward,
which the lout had rolled the day before. He
stepped upon it, and he might have been walking
on plush. As he went, the sound of sobs
grew heavier, and he could count the checked
breaths. He heard a man’s voice say softly:
‘My poor girl! Mary, Mary, courage.’ There
was no mistaking that gentle and soothing
voice, though he had heard it rasping and
angry the night before. A break in the column
of trees showed him a picture, the very reverse
of the sweet domestic English picture that had
charmed him a few hours ago.</p>

<p>The Countess of Harborough was weeping
bitterly in Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy’s arms.

<p>Fred Luffington had once had the misfortune
to see ‘an impossible brute’ preferred to his
elegant self by an old love of Antwerp, hence
he had long given up pondering the oddnesses
of women’s love-fancies. He was a gentleman
as well, and kept that sharply incorrect picture
to himself. He met the countess again, and
dropped his eyes, ashamed of his knowledge.
Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy he eyed with a droll
smile, and the more he looked at him, the more
incomprehensible the matter appeared.</p>

<p>But he was good company, that Fred admitted
heartily, and shook his hand with a cordial
hope of meeting him again, now that their little
difference was settled, and had led to such
cheery results. He counselled him to take to
claret, and to himself remarked that his domestic
ethics seemed none the better for the drinking
of port, which evidently had not taught him
to let his neighbour’s wife alone. He had
met Lord Harborough once crossing the Park,
and perfectly understood the countess’s sobs.
That was all he did understand. He could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
fancy himself sobbing if he were a woman
condemned to live his days with that hard-featured,
red-haired little man, bearing himself
so primly and so distractingly respectable.</p>

<p>‘Yes, that explains her odd choice,’ said
Luffington, turning his back upon Fendon,
after a last grasp of the Flemish priest’s hand.
‘There’s a taint of disreputableness about the
local hero, who looks as if he had rolled so
much in the dust in infancy, that neither soap
nor brush has been able to give him a respectable
head ever since.’</p>

<p>Fred Luffington went abroad again, and
forgot all about the Flemish priest and the half
revealed drama of Fendon. A couple of years
later he had engaged to meet some friends at
Lugano and, travelling from Basle, decided to
leave the train at the entrance to the St.
Gothard tunnel, and walk over the mountain.
The weather was glorious, and such scenery is
enough to make a saint of the biggest sinner.
The flush of roseate snows, whose white from
very purity is driven to flame; the crystal
splendours above, the shadows of the valleys
revealed in the twisted gaps like flakes of blue
cloud softening the sunny whiteness, wooded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
depths and sparkling water, with the ineffable
beauty of the turquoise stillness of the grand
lake below: combined to make even the breathing
of a worldly young man a prayer of thanksgiving.
Fred Luffington never could gaze on
the Alps without feeling his sins drop from
him like a garment, and his soul stand out,
naked and innocent before the majesty of
creation.</p>

<p>He had been walking since mid-day, with
rests in craggy nooks, and now at sundown it
behoved him to look out for shelter. He
waited until he had seen the last effects of an
Alpine sunset before branching into a narrow
wooded path, which he was informed led to a
little village. At the first châlet, he knocked
for admittance, and a fat woman came to the
door, in a state of evident perturbation. Her
face cleared when she discovered that he spoke
Italian.</p>

<p>‘There is a sick man here. We think he
must be an Englishman, but we do not understand
him, and he neither knows French nor
Italian. If the gentleman would but look at
him. The doctor says he will not recover,’ she
burst out, without stopping for breath.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Luffington followed her upstairs, and entered
a tolerably clean little room, where the sick
man lay, either asleep or unconscious. Luffington
stood, and looked at him long and musingly.
Where ever had he seen that thin, sharp,
foreign face, the curls of dust-hued black, the
oddly beautiful brow and full lips? A small
brown hand lay upon the coverlet, and it
sprang a gush of sympathy to his eyes. Suddenly
the closed lids opened and revealed eyes
of the sombre dead blackness of the sloe, without
the red and yellow flames he now so vividly
remembered. So this was the end of that
sorry drama of Fendon! Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy
was dying in a far-off Swiss village on the top
of St. Gothard. And the countess? Fred bent,
and whispered his name, and begged to be used
as a friend. A gleam of recognition broke the
dark blankness of the dying man’s glance, and
he made a feeble movement of his hand, which
Luffington caught and held in a gentle clasp.
The sick man’s eyes filled gratefully. He knew
he was dying, and he was comforted by the
presence of Luffington.</p>

<p>All through the night Fred sat and nursed
him. He was melted in kindness and gratitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
that this chance of redeeming some unworthy
hours had fallen to him. He held the dying
man’s hand, listened to his babble, and promised
to destroy a packet of letters in a certain ebony
box, into which he was to place poor Fitzroy’s
watch and pocket book, and a copy of the
<i>Spanish Gypsy</i>, the only book he possessed,
and deliver it into the hands of the Countess of
Harborough. In the presence of death, Fred
could hear her name without any squeamishness.</p>

<p>‘Take from under my pillow a locket, and
open it for me. I want to see her face again.’</p>

<p>Fred did so, and could not help recognising
the features of the countess. He asked if Mr.
Fitzroy had any other friends to whom he could
carry messages.</p>

<p>‘Friends? I have none,’ he said, in a toneless
way, empty of all bitterness or pain. ‘I neither
sought friendship nor offered it. I have loved
but one being on this earth, and it has been my
duty to stand by and see her suffer, and now I
must go, while she remains behind unhappy,
with none to comfort her. There is no comfort
on earth for miserable wives. When I think of
them, I am wroth to hear men complain. What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
do we know about pain compared with them?
And yet they bear it. The God that made
them alone can explain how. But this last
blow! How will she bear that? Mary, Mary,
my poor unhappy girl!’</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and seemed to dose, then
opened them, and clutched Luffington’s fingers,
like a startled child.</p>

<p>‘Don’t leave me,’ he breathed, through shut
teeth. ‘It is so lonely among strangers. Ah,
if I were only back in my room in the ‘St.
George and the Dragon,’ with good Mrs.
Matcham! Poor Mary! The worst of it is, I
have never been able to punch that rascal’s
head. Never. For her sake, I have had to “my
Lord” him, when I wanted to be at his throat.
Well, I played the game gallantly. Nobody
can deny that. It’s for her now to continue it
alone. The locket! Where’s the locket?
Let it go with me. It contains all I have loved
on earth, and I’ll lie all the quieter underground
for having it with me.’</p>

<p>The dawn found him lifeless, and Luffington
sitting with his stiff cold hand clasped in his
own. The locket, containing the likeness of
the Countess of Harborough and a thick twist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
of blonde hair, was buried, along with the
remains of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy, in a little
Alpine churchyard.</p>

<hr class="tb" >

<p>One summer evening, the Flemish priest of
Fendon was reading his breviary in the garden,
not so intent upon prayer that he had no eye
for his flower-beds, which he had just watered.
He turned hastily as the garden gate swung
back, and recognised Fred Luffington, who
approached with an air of unwonted gravity.
He carried a square parcel under his arm.</p>

<p>‘My dear young friend,’ cried the enchanted
priest, keeping, while he spoke, a finger between
the leaves of his breviary.</p>

<p>‘I have a painful commission for you. You
must take this box at once to the Countess of
Harborough, and acquaint her with the news
that Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy is dead. I buried him
in Switzerland a month ago.’</p>

<p>The priest shook his head sadly. He
scrutinised Luffington’s features sharply, and
said—</p>

<p>‘Thank God, she knows that already—that
is, the death. But I suspect this box will open
old wounds.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>‘Poor woman! Tell her Mr. Fitzroy sent
this by a trusted friend. I destroyed her
letters. For her sake, I wish I were not in the
secret, but unhappily, by accident, I learnt it
long before I found the poor fellow dying in
a Swiss châlet.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ muttered the priest, and felt for his
pipe. ‘It’s unfortunate. Not a soul but myself
has known it for years—not even the earl,
and such a secret has cost me many an uncomfortable
moment.’</p>

<p>Luffington cast a strange glance upon him.
His words were inexplicable. Known it for
years! Secret unshared by the earl! Was
the ground solid beneath his feet, that a virtuous
priest should contemplate the likelihood of such
a secret being shared with the earl?</p>

<p>‘It’s not to be feared I should betray a lady.
God knows, I am no saint myself, to blame
anybody.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t blame her much myself. I deplore
the need for duplicity, but it was not her doing.
They placed her in a false position. But while
I cannot but admire the tenacity of her affections
and her loyalty to a natural claim, I have
ever been urging her to make a clean breast of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
it to her husband. It was not her business to
expiate the wrong of others, but confession
would have placed her and the unfortunate
man now in his grave upon a proper footing,
and lent the dignity of candour to their relations.’</p>

<p>Luffington felt mercilessly mystified. Even
suppose the lovers not altogether criminal, how
could the earl’s recognition of their irregular
situation lend dignity to it? He spoke his
perplexity, and cast the good priest into a
panic.</p>

<p>‘What did you mean by telling me you knew
everything?’ he cried, wrathfully. ‘Malcolm
Fitzroy her ladyship’s lover! Poor woman,
poor woman! I thought you knew, and now I
must break confidence, to clear her, and tell
you the wretched story.’</p>

<p>He drew Fred into his study, carefully closed
the door, and there laid bare a situation as odd
as the personality of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy. A
titled lady in Northumberland lost a new-born
infant, and was herself pronounced in danger
unless a child could be found to take its place.
A gypsy outcast was discovered to have given
birth to twins on the same day, and was glad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
enough to resign the baby girl to the bereaved
aristocrat. The twins were the result of an
intrigue between an English gentleman and
a handsome gypsy. The little girl blossomed
into youth, as English and refined as could be,
and her foster-mother, whose life she had saved,
could not bring herself to part with her. As
no other children came, she grew up the
daughter of the house, adored by her self-made
parents. The boy was his mother’s son, an
intractable vagrant, incapable of control, with
the saving grace of a passionate attachment to
his sister.</p>

<p>When the Earl of Harborough came forward
as a suitor, the old lord and his wife debated
long upon their duty to him and to his
house, and their desire for their darling’s advancement.
The latter instinct prevailed, and
the earl believed himself the husband of a well-born
English maiden. The adopted parents
were both dead, and the countess, unhappy in
her marriage, had nobody to turn to in her
troubles but her gypsy brother. To make good
his dubious footing at the Hall, Fitzroy had
cast himself in the way of the earl, and secured
an extraordinary popularity in the village and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
upon the estate. The earl thought him a droll
fellow, unbent patronisingly to him, and enjoyed
his odd vagabond habits.</p>

<p>This was the secret of Mr. Malcolm Fitzroy
and the Countess of Harborough.

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LITTLE_MARQUIS">THE LITTLE MARQUIS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">H<b>ERVÉ</b> <b>DE</b> V<b>ERVAINVILLE</b></span>, Marquis de Saint-Laurent,
was at once the biggest and smallest
landlord of Calvados, the most important personage
of that department and the most insignificant
and powerless. Into his cradle the
fairies had dropped all the gifts of fortune but
those two, without which the others taste as
ashes—love and happiness. His life was uncoloured
by the affections of home, and his
days, like his ragged little visage and his dull
personality, were vague, with the vagueness of
negative misery. Of his nurse he was meekly
afraid, and his relations with the other servants
were of the most distantly polite and official
nature. He understood that they were there
to do his bidding nominally, and compel him
actually to do theirs, pending his hour of
authority. With a little broken sigh, he envied
the happiness that he rootedly believed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
accompany the more cheerful proportions of
the cottager’s experience, of which he occasionally
caught glimpses in his daily walks, remembering
the chill solitude of his own big
empty castle and the immense park that seemed
an expansion of his imprisonment, including,
as part of his uninterrupted gloom, the kindly
meadows and woods, the babbling streams and
leafy avenues, where the birds sang of joys
uncomprehended by him.</p>

<p>Play was as foreign to him as hope. Every
morning he gravely saluted the picture of his
pretty mother, which hung in his bedroom, a
lovely picture, hardly real in its dainty Greuze-like
charm, arch and frail and innocent, the
bloom of whose eighteen years had been sacrificed
upon his own coming, leaving a copy
washed of all beauty, its delicacy blurred in
a half-effaced boyish visage without character
or colouring. Of his father Hervé never spoke,—shrinking,
with the unconscious pride of race,
from the male interloper who had been glad
enough to drop an inferior name, and was considered
by his friends to have waltzed himself
and his handsome eyes into an enviable bondage.
And the only return he could make to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
the house that had so benefited him was a
flying visit from Paris to inspect the heir and
confer with his son’s steward (whose guardian
he had been appointed by the old marquis at
his death), and then return to his city pleasures,
which he found more entertaining than his
Norman neighbours.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning little Hervé was conducted
to High Mass in the church of Saint-Laurent,
upon the broad highroad leading to
the town of Falaise. Duly escorted up the
aisle by an obsequious Swiss in military hat
and clanking sword, with a long blonde moustache
that excited the boy’s admiration, Hervé
and his nurse were bowed into the colossal
family pew, as large as a moderate-sized
chamber, roughly carven and running along
the flat wide tombs of his ancestors, on which
marble statues of knights and mediæval ladies
lay lengthways. The child’s air of melancholy
and solitary state was enough to make any
honest heart ache, and his presence never failed
to waken the intense interest of the simple
congregation, and supply them with food for
speculation as to his future over their mid-day
soup and cider. Hard indeed would it have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
been to define the future of the little man
sitting so decorously in his huge pew, and
following the long services in a spirit of almost
pathetic conventionality and resignation, only
very occasionally relieved by his queer broken
sigh, that had settled into a trick, or a furtive
wandering of his eyes, that sought distraction
among ancestral epitaphs.</p>

<p>He was not, it must be owned, an engaging
child, though soft-hearted and timidly attracted
by animals, whose susceptibilities he would
have feared to offend by any uninvited demonstration
of affection. He had heard himself
described as plain and dull, and thought it his
duty to refrain as much as possible from inflicting
his presence upon others, preferring
loneliness to adverse criticism. But he had
one friend who had found him out, and taken
him to her equally unhappy and tender heart.
The Comtesse de Fresney, a lady of thirty,
was, like himself, miserable and misunderstood.
Hervé thought she must be very beautiful for
him to love her so devotedly, and he looked
forward with much eagerness to the time of
her widowhood, when he should be free to
marry her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>There was something inexpressibly sad in
the drollery of their relations. Neither was
aware of the comic element, while both were
profoundly impressed with the sadness. Whenever
a fair, a race, or a company of strolling
players took the tyrannical count away from
Fresney, a messenger was at once despatched
to Saint-Laurent, and gladly the little marquis
trotted off to console his friend.</p>

<p>One day Hervé gave expression to his
matrimonial intentions. The countess, sitting
with her hands in her lap, was gazing gloomily
out of the window, when she turned, and said,
sighing: ‘Do you know, Hervé, that I have
never even been to Paris?’</p>

<p>Hervé did not know, and was not of an age
to measure the frightful depth of privation confessed.
But the countess spoke in a sadder
voice than usual, and, in response to her sigh,
his childish lips parted in his own vague little
sigh.</p>

<p>‘When I am grown up, I’ll take you to Paris,
Countess,’ he said, coming near, and timidly
fondling her hand.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Hervé,’ said the countess, and she
stooped to kiss him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>‘M. le Comte is so old that he will probably
be dead by that time, and then I can marry
you, Countess, and you will live always at
Saint-Laurent. You know it is bigger than
Fresney.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Hervé,’ said the countess musingly,
thinking of her lost years and dead dreams,
as she stared across the pleasant landscape.</p>

<p>Hervé regarded himself as an engaged gentleman
from that day. The following Sunday he
studied the epitaph on the tomb of the last
Marquis, his grandfather, who had vanished
into the darkness of an unexplored continent,
with notebook and scientific intent, to leave
his bones to whiten in the desert and the name
of a brave man to adorn his country’s annals.
Hervé was all excitement to learn from the
countess the precise meaning of the words
<i>distinguished</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">explorer</i>.</p>

<p>‘Countess,’ he hurried to ask, ‘what is it to
be distinguished?’</p>

<p>‘It is greatly to do great things, Hervé.’</p>

<p>‘And what does <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">explorer</i> mean?’</p>

<p>‘To go far away into the unknown; to find
out unvisited places, and teach others how
much larger the world is than they imagine.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>This explanation thrilled new thoughts and
ambition in the breast of the little marquis.
Why should not he begin at once to explore
the world, and see for himself what lay beyond
the dull precincts of Saint-Laurent? He then
would become distinguished like his grandfather,
and the countess would be proud of
him. The scheme hurried his pulses, and gave
him his first taste of excitement, which stood
him in place of a very small appetite. He
watched his moment in the artful instinct of
childhood with a scheme in its head. It was
not difficult to elude a careless nurse and
gossiping servants, and he knew an alley by
which the broad straight road, leading from
the castle to the town, might be reached over
a friendly stile that involved no pledge of
secrecy from an untrustworthy lodge-keeper.
And away he was scampering along the hedge,
drunk with excitement and the glory of his
own unprotected state, drunk with the spring
sunshine and the smell of violets that made
breathing a bliss.</p>

<p>Picture a tumble-down town, with a quantity
of little streets breaking unexpectedly into
glimpses of green meadow and foliage; rickety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
omnibuses, jerking and rumbling upon uncouth
wheels, mysteriously held by their drivers from
laying their contents upon the jagged pavements;
little old-fashioned squares, washed by
runlets for paving divisions, with the big names
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Trinité</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saint-Gervais</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guillaume le Conquérant</i>,
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Turc</i>,—the latter the
most unlikely form of heretic ever to have
shaken the equilibrium of the quaint town;
a public fountain, a market-place, many-aisled
churches, smelling of damp and decay, their
fretted arches worn with age, and their pictures
bleached of all colour by the moist stone;
primitive shops, latticed windows, asthmatical
old men in blouses and night-caps, in which
they seem to have been born and in which
they promise to die; girls in linen towers and
starched side-flaps concealing every curl and
wave of their hair, their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</i> beating the
flags with the click of castanets; groups of
idle huzzars, moustached and menacing, strutting
the dilapidated public gardens like walking
arsenals, the eternal cigarette between their
lips, and the everlasting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sapristi</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacré</i> upon
them. Throw in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i> or two, wide-hatted,
of leisured and benevolent aspect, with a smile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
addressed to the world as a general <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon enfant</i>;
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbé</i>, less leisured and less assured of public
indulgence; a discreet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frère</i>, whose hurrying
movements shake his robes to the dimensions
of a balloon; an elegant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-préfet</i>, conscious
of Parisian tailoring, and much in request in
provincial salons; a wooden-legged colonel,
devoted to the memory of the first Napoleon,
and wrathful at that of him of Sedan; a few
civilians of professional calling, deferential to
the military and in awe of the colonel; the
local gossip and shopkeeper on Trinity Square,
Mère Lescaut, who knows everything about
everybody, and the usual group of antagonistic
politicians. For the outskirts, five broad roads
diverging star-wise from a common centre, with
an inviting simplicity of aspect that might
tempt the least adventurous spirit of childhood
to make, by one of those pleasant, straight, and
leafy paths, for the alluring horizon. Add the
local lion, Great William’s Tower, a very respectable
Norman ruin, where a more mythical
personage than William might easily have been
born, and which might very well hallow more
ancient loves than those of Robert and the
washerwoman Arletta; a splendid equestrian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
statue of the Conqueror, and a quantity of
threads of silver water running between mossy
banks, where women in mountainous caps of
linen wash clothes, and the violets in spring
and autumn grow so thickly, that the air is
faint with their sweet scent. Afar, green field
upon green field, stretching on all sides, till the
atmospheric blue blots out their colour and
melts them into the sky; sudden spaces of
wood making shadows upon the bright plains
and dusty roads, fringed with poplars, cutting
uninterrupted paths to the horizon.</p>

<p>The weekly fair was being held on the Place
de la Trinité, when Hervé made his way so
far. The noise and jollity stunned him. Long
tables were spread round, highly coloured and
decorated with a variety of objects, and good-humoured
cleanly Norman women in caps, and
men in blue blouses, were shouting exchanged
speech, or wrangling decorously. Hervé thrust
his hands into his pockets in a pretence of
security, like that assumed by his elders upon
novel occasions, though his pulses shook with
unaccustomed force and velocity; and he
walked round the tables with uneasy impulses
towards the toys and sweetmeats, and thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
a ride on the merry-go-round would be an
enviable sensation. But these temptations he
gallantly resisted, as unbecoming his serious
business. Women smiled upon him, and called
him, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce joli petit monsieur</i>, a fact which caused
him more surprise than anything else, having
heard his father describe him as ugly. He
bowed to them, when he rejected their offers
of toys and penknives, but could not resist the
invitation of a fresh cake, and held his hat
in one hand, while he searched in his pocket
to pay for it. Hervé made up for his dulness
by a correctness of demeanour that was rather
depressing than captivating.</p>

<p>Munching his cake with a secret pleasure
in this slight infringement of social law, he
wandered upon the skirt of the noisy and good-natured
crowd, which, in the settlement of its
affairs, was lavish in smiles and jokes. What
should he do with his liberty and leisure when
his senses had tired of this particular form of
intoxication? He bethought himself of the
famous tower which Pierrot, the valet, had
assured him was the largest castle in the world.
Glancing up the square, he saw the old wooden-legged
colonel limping towards him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
Hervé promptly decided that so warlike a
personage could not fail to be aware of the
direction in which the tower lay. He barred
the colonel’s way with his hat in his hand, and
said: ‘Please, Monsieur, will you be so good
as to direct me to the castle of William the
Conqueror?’</p>

<p>The colonel heard the soft tremulous pipe,
and brought his fierce glare down upon the
urchin with hawklike penetration. Fearful
menace seemed to lie in the final tap of his
wooden leg upon the pavement, as he came to
a standstill in front of Hervé, and he cleared
his chest with a loud military sound like <i>boom</i>.
Hervé stood the sound, but winced and repeated
his request more timidly. Now this
desperate-looking soldier had a kindly heart, and
loved children. He had not the least idea that
his loud <i>boom</i>, and his shaggy eyebrows, and
his great scowling red face frightened the life
out of them. A request from a child so small
and feeble to be directed to anybody’s castle,
much less the Conqueror’s, when so many strong
and idle arms in the world must be willing
to carry him, afflicted him with an almost
maternal throb of tenderness. By his smile he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
dispersed the unpleasant impressions of his
<i>boom</i> and the click of his artificial limb, and
completely won Hervé’s confidence, who was
quite pleased to find his thin little fingers lost
in the grasp of his new companion’s large hand,
when the giant in uniform turned and volunteered
to conduct him to the tower. Crossing
the Square of Guillaume le Conquérant, Hervé
even became expansive.</p>

<p>‘Look, Monsieur,’ he cried, pointing to the
beautiful bronze statue, ‘one would say that
the horse was about to jump, and throw the
knight.’</p>

<p>The colonel slapped his chest like a man
insulted in the person of a glorious ancestor,
and emitted an unusually gruff <i>boom</i>, that
nearly blew little Hervé to the other side of the
square, and made his lips tremble.</p>

<p>‘I’d like, young sir, to see the horse that
could have thrown that man,’ said the Norman.</p>

<p>‘There was a Baron of Vervainville when
Robert was Duke of Normandy. He went
with Robert to the Crusades. The countess
has told me that only very distinguished and
brave people went to the Crusades in those
days. They were wars, Monsieur, a great way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
off. I often try to make out what is written on
his tomb in Saint-Laurent, but I can never get
further than Geoffroi,’ Hervé concluded, with
his queer short sigh, while in front of them rose
the mighty Norman ruin upon the landscape,
like the past glancing poignantly through an
ever youthful smile.</p>

<p>The colonel, enlightened by this communication
upon the lad’s identity, stared at him in
alarmed surprise.</p>

<p>‘Is there nobody in attendance upon M. le
Marquis?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I am trying to be an explorer like my
grandpapa; that is why I have run away at
once. I am obliged to you, Monsieur, but it
is not necessary that you should give yourself
the trouble to come further with me. I shall
be able to find the way back to the Place de la
Trinité.’</p>

<p>The colonel was dubious as to his right to
accept dismissal. The sky looked threatening,
and he hardly believed that he could in honour
forsake the child. But, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sapristi!</i> there were
the unread papers down from Paris waiting for
him at his favourite haunt, the Café du Grand
Turc, to be discussed between generous draughts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
of cider. He tugged his grey moustache in
divided feelings, and at last came to a decision
with the aid of his terrible <i>boom</i>. He would
deliver the little marquis into the hands of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> of the tower, and after a look in upon
his cronies at the Grand Turc and a glass of
cider, hasten to Saint-Laurent in search of
proper authority.</p>

<p>Hervé was a decorous sightseer, who left
others much in the dark as to his private impressions
of what he saw. The tower, he admitted,
was very big and cold. He did not
think it would give him much satisfaction to
have been born in the chill cavernous chamber
wherein William had first seen the light, while
the bombastic lines upon the conquest of the
Saxons, read to him in a strong Norman accent,
gave him the reverse of a desire to explore that
benighted land. With his hands in his pockets,
he stood and peeped through the slit in the
stone wall, nearly as high as the clouds,
whence Robert is supposed to have detected
the charming visage of Arletta, washing linen
below, with a keenness of sight nothing less
diabolical than his sobriquet, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le diable</i>.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t see anybody down so far, could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
you?’ he asked; and then his attention was
caught by the big rain-drops that were beginning
to fall in black circles upon the unroofed
stone stairs. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> watched the
sky a moment, then lifted Hervé into his arms,
and hurried down the innumerable steps to the
shelter of his own cosy parlour. Excitement
and fatigue were telling upon the child, who
looked nervous and scared. The rain-drops
had gathered the force and noise of several
waterfalls, pouring from the heavens with
diluvian promise. Already the landscape was
drenched and blotted out of view. An
affrighted peasant, in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</i> large enough to
shelter the woman and her family of nursery
rhyme, darted down the road, holding a
coloured umbrella as big as a tent. The roar
of thunder came from afar, and a flash of lightning
broke through the vapoury veil, making
Hervé blink like a distracted owl caught by the
dawn. Oh, if he were only back safely at
Saint-Laurent, or could hold the hand of his
dear countess! No, he would not explore any
more until he was a grown-up man. A howl
of thunder and a child’s feeble cry——</p>

<p>Meanwhile confusion reigned in the castle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
Men and women flew hither and thither,
screaming blame upon each other. In an
agony of apprehension, the butler ordered the
family coach, and was driven into town, wondering
how M. le Vervainville would take the
news if anything were to happen to remove the
source of his wealth and local importance.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</i> he would not be the man to tell him.
Crossing the Place de la Trinité, he caught
sight of Mère Lescaut gazing out upon the
deluged square. In a happy inspiration, he
determined to consult her, and while he was
endeavouring to make his knock heard above
the tempest and to shield his eyes from the
glare of the lightning flashes, Mère Lescaut
thrust her white cap out through the upper half
of the shop door, and screamed, ‘You are
looking for M. le Marquis de Saint-Laurent,
and I saw him cross the square with Colonel
Larousse this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diable! Diable!</i>’ roared the distracted butler.
‘I passed the colonel on the road an hour ago.’</p>

<p>The endless moments lost in adjuring the
gods, in voluble faith in calamity, in imprecations
at the storm, and shivering assertions of
discomfort which never mend matters, and at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
last the dripping colonel and swearing butler
meet. M. le Marquis de Saint-Laurent and
Baron de Vervainville was found asleep amid
the historic memories of Robert and Arletta.</p>

<p>This escapade brought M. de Vervainville
down from Paris, with a new tutor. The tutor
was very young, very modern, and very cynical.
He was not in the least interested in Hervé,
though rather amused when, on the second day
of their acquaintance, the boy asked—‘Monsieur,
are you engaged to be married?’ The tutor was
happy to say that he had not that misfortune.</p>

<p>‘Is it then a misfortune? I am very glad that
I am engaged, though I have heard my nurse
say that married people are not often happy.’</p>

<p>The tutor thought it not improbable such an
important personage as the Marquis de Saint-Laurent
had been officially betrothed to some
desirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i> of infant years, and asked her
age and name.</p>

<p>‘The Countess de Fresney. She is not a little
girl, and at present her husband is alive, but I
daresay he will be dead soon. You know, Monsieur,
she is a great deal older than I am, but I
shall like that much better. It will not be
necessary for me to learn much, for she will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
know everything for me, and I can amuse myself.
I will take you to see her to-morrow. She
is very beautiful,—but not so beautiful as my
mamma—and I love her very dearly.’</p>

<p>It occurred to the cynical tutor that the
countess might be bored enough in this uncheerful
place to take an interest in so captivating
a person as himself. But when they arrived
at Fresney, they learnt that the countess was
seriously ill. Hervé began to cry when he was
refused permission to see his friend, and at that
moment M. le Comte, an erratic, middle-aged
tyrant, held in mortal terror by his dependants,
burst in upon him, with a vigorous—‘Ho,
ho! the little marquis, my rival! Come hither,
sirrah, and let me run the sword of vengeance
through your body.’</p>

<p>And the merry old rascal began to roll his
eyes, and mutter strange guttural sounds for his
own amusement and Hervé’s fright.</p>

<p>‘I do not care if you do kill me, M. le Comte,’
the boy sobbed. ‘You are a wicked man,
and it is because you make dear Madame
unhappy that she is so ill. You are as wicked
and ugly as the ogre in the story she gave me
last Christmas. But she will get well, and you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
will die, and then I will marry her, and she will
never be unhappy any more.’</p>

<p>‘Take him away before I kill him—the insolent
little jackanapes! In love with a married
woman, and telling it to her husband! Ho, ho!
so I am an ogre! Very well, let me make a meal
of you.’ With that he produced an orange
and offered it to Hervé, who turned on his
heel, and stumbled out of the room, blinded
with tears.</p>

<p>But the countess did not get well. She sent
for Hervé one day, and kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p>‘My little boy, my little Hervé, you will soon
be alone again. But you will find another
friend, and by and by you will be happy.’</p>

<p>‘Never, never, if you die, Countess. I shall
not care for anything, not even for my new
pony, though it has such a pretty white star on
its forehead. I do not want to grow up, and I
shall never be married now, nor—nothing,’ he
cried, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>That evening his friend died, and the news
was brought to Hervé, as he and the tutor sat
over their supper. Hervé pushed away his
plate, and took his scared and desolated little
heart to the solitude of his own room. During
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
the night, the tutor was awakened by his
call.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur, please to tell me what happens
when people die.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, there is nothing more about them,’
cried the tutor.</p>

<p>‘And what are those who do not die supposed
to do?’</p>

<p>‘To moderate their feelings,—and go to
sleep.’</p>

<p>‘But I cannot sleep, Monsieur. I am very
unhappy. Oh, I wish it had been the count.
Why doesn’t God kill wicked persons? Is it
wicked to wish the count to be dead, Monsieur?’</p>

<p>‘Very.’</p>

<p>‘Then I must be dreadfully wicked, for I
would like to kill him myself, if I were big
and strong.’</p>

<p>At breakfast next day, he asked if people did
not wear very black clothes when their friends
died, and indited a curious epistle to his father,
begging permission to wear the deepest mourning
for the lady he was to have married. Vested
in black, his little mouse-coloured head looked
more pitiful and vague than ever, as he sat out
the long funeral service in the church of Saint-Gervais,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
and lost himself in endless efforts to
count the candles, and understand what the
strange catafalque and velvet pall in the middle
of the church meant, and what had become of
the countess.</p>

<p>After the burial his tutor took him to the
cemetery. The bereaved child carried a big
wreath to lay upon the grave of his departed
lady-love. Kneeling there, upon the same
mission, was M. le Comte, shedding copious
tears, and apostrophising the dead he had
made it a point to wound in life. Hervé knelt
opposite him, and stared at him indignantly.
Why should he cry? The countess had not
loved him, nor had he loved the countess. The
boy flung himself down on the soft earth, and
began to sob bitterly. The thought that he
would never again see his lost friend took full
possession of him for the first time, and he
wanted to die himself. Disturbed by this
passionate outbreak, the count rose, brushed
the earth from his new trousers with a mourning
pocket-handkerchief already drenched with
his tears, and proceeded to lift Hervé.</p>

<p>‘The dear defunct was much attached to you,
little marquis,’ he said, and began to wipe away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
Hervé’s tears with the handkerchief made sacred
by his own. ‘You were like a son to her.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want you to dry my eyes, Monsieur,’
Hervé exploded, bursting from his enemy’s
arms. ‘I do not like you, and I always thought
you would die soon, and not Madame. It isn’t
just, and I will not be friends with you. I shall
hate you always, for you are a wicked man, and
you were cruel to Madame.’</p>

<p>The count, who was not himself accounted
sane by his neighbours, looked at the amused
and impassable tutor, and significantly touched
his forehead.</p>

<p>‘Hereditary,’ he muttered, and stood to make
way for Hervé.</p>

<p>The birds were singing deliciously, the late
afternoon sunshine gathered above the quiet
trees (made quieter by here and there an
unmovable cypress and a melancholy yew, fit
symbols of the rest of death) into a pale golden
mist shot with slanting rays of light, and the
violets’ was the only scent to shake by suggestion
the sense of soothing negation of all emotion
or remembrance. Out upon the road, running
like a broad ribbon to the town, unanimated in
the gentle illumination of the afternoon, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
tutor and Hervé met the colonel limping along
one might imagine, upon the sound of a
prolonged <i>boom</i>. Hervé’s tears were dried, but
his face looked sorrowful and stained enough
to spring tears of sympathy to any kind
eyes. The colonel drew up, touched his cap,
and uttered his customary signal with more
than his customary gruffness. Hervé stood
his ground firmly, though he winced, for he was
a delicate child unused to rough sounds.</p>

<p>‘How goes it, M. le Marquis? How goes it?’
shouted the colonel.</p>

<p>‘M. le colonel, it goes very badly with me, but
I try to bear it. My tutor tells me that men do
not fret; I wish I knew how they manage not to
do so when they are sad. I did want to grow up
soon, and explore the world like my grandpapa,
and then I should have married the Countess
of Fresney, if her husband were dead. But
now everything is different, and I don’t even
want to see the tower of William the Conqueror
again. I don’t want to grow up. I don’t want
anything now.’</p>

<p>‘Poor little man!’ said the colonel, patting
his shoulder. ‘You’ve lost a friend, but you
will gain others, and perhaps you’ll be a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
soldier one of these days, like the little
Corporal.’</p>

<p>Hervé shook his head dolorously. He saw
nothing ahead but unpleasant lessons varied by
sad excursions to the countess’s grave.</p>

<p>The unhappy little marquis was moping and
fading visibly. He could not be got to take an
interest in his lessons, and he proudly strove to
conceal the fact that he was afraid of his tutor’s
mocking smile. The news of his ill-health
reached M. de Vervainville in Paris, and at once
brought that alarmed gentleman down to
Falaise. On Hervé’s life depended his town
luxuries and his importance as a landed proprietor.
Was there anything his son wished for?
Hervé reflected a while, then raised his mouse-coloured
head, and sighed his own little sigh. He
thought he should like to see Colonel Larousse.
And so it came that one morning, staring out
of the window, the boy saw a familiar military
figure limping up the avenue. Hervé’s worried
small countenance almost glowed with expectation,
as he rushed to welcome his visitor,
the sound of whose <i>boom</i> and the tap of his
wooden leg upon the parquet, as well as his
dreadful shaggy eyebrows, seemed even cheerful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>‘Do you think, Monsieur,’ Hervé asked gravely
‘that you would mind having for a friend such
a very little boy as I?’</p>

<p>The colonel cleared his throat and felt his
eyes required the same operation, though he
concealed that fact from Hervé.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Boom! Touchez là, mon brave.’</p>

<p>Never yet had Hervé heard speech so hearty
and so republican. It astonished him, and filled
him with a sense of perfect ease and trust. It
was like a free breath in oppressive etiquette,—the
child-prince’s first mud-pie upon the common
road of humanity. Hervé became excited, and
confided to the colonel that his father had
ordered a toy sailing-boat for him, and that
there was going to be a ball at Saint-Laurent in
honour of his birthday, though he was not quite
sure that he would enjoy that so much as the
boat, for he had never danced, and could not
play any games like other children. Still if
Colonel Larousse would come, they could talk
about soldiers. Come? Of course the colonel
came, looking in his brushed uniform as one of
the heroes home from Troy, and Hervé admired
him prodigiously.</p>

<p>The birthday ball was a great affair. Guests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
came all the way from Caen and Lisieux, and
Hervé, more bewildered than elated, stood
beside his splendid father to receive them.
Ladies in lovely robes, shedding every delicate
scent, like flowers, petted him, and full-grown
men, looking at these ladies, made much of him.
They told him that he was charming, but he did
not believe them. One cannot be both ugly
and charming, little Hervé thought, with much
bitterness and an inclination to cry. Their
compliments gave him the same singular
sensations evoked by the tutor’s smile.</p>

<p>‘I do not know any of these people,’ he said
sadly to Colonel Larousse. ‘I don’t think a
ball very cheerful, do you? It makes my head
ache to hear so many strange voices, and feel
so much smaller than anybody else. My papa
amuses himself, but I would like to run away to
my boat.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boom! Mon camarade</i>, a soldier sticks to
his post.’</p>

<p>Hervé sighed, and thought if the countess
had been here that he would have sat beside
her all the evening, and have held her hand.
And the knowledge that he would never again
hold her hand, and that so many long weeks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
had passed since fond lips had kissed his face,
and a sweet voice had called him ‘Little Hervé,
little boy,’ brought tears of desperate self-pitying
pain to his eyes. In these large illuminated
salons, vexed with the mingled odours of
flowers and scented skirts, by the scraping of
fiddles and the flying feet of laughing dancers,
unmindful of him as other than a queer quiet
boy in velvet and Alençon lace, with a plain
grey little face and owlish eyes that never
smiled, Hervé felt more alone than ever he had
felt since the countess’s death.</p>

<p>Stealthily he made his escape through the
long open window, and ran down the dewy
lawn. How gratefully the cool air tasted and
the lovely stillness of the night after the aching
brilliancy within! Hervé assured himself that
it was a pleasant relief, and hoped there would
not be many more balls at the castle.</p>

<p>The lake fringed the lawn, and moored
against the branches of a weeping willow was
his toy-boat, just as he had left it in the afternoon.
It would look so pretty, he believed,
sailing under the rising moon that touched the
water silver and the blue stars that showed so
peacefully upon it. He unknotted the string,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
and gaily the little boat swam out upon his
impulsion. If only the countess could come
back to him, he thought, with his boat he would
be perfectly happy. ‘But I am so alone among
them all,’ he said to himself, with his broken
sigh. ‘I wished somebody loved me as little
children are loved by their mammas.’</p>

<p>The boat had carried away the string from
his loose grasp, and he reached out his arm
upon the water to recover it. A soft, moist
bank, a small eager foot upon it, a frame easily
tilted by an unsteady movement, the dark
water broken into circling bubbles upon a
child’s shrill cry of terror, and closing impassably
over the body of poor forlorn little
Hervé and his pretty velvet suit and Alençon
lace,—this is what the stars and the pale calm
moon saw; and over there upon the further
shore of the lake floated the toy-boat as
placidly as if it had worked no treachery, and
had not led to the extinction of an illustrious
name and race.</p>

<p>‘Where is M. le Marquis?’ demanded M. de
Vervainville, interrupting an enchanting moment
upon discovery of his son’s absence from the
salon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>A search, a hurry, a scare,—music stopped,
wine-glasses at the buffet laid down untouched,
ices rejected, fear and anxiety upon every face.
M. le Marquis is not in the salons, nor in the
tutor’s apartment, nor in his own. The grounds
are searched, ‘Hervé’ and ‘M. le Marquis’
ringing through the silence unanswered. His
boat was found and the impress of small footsteps
upon the wet bank. M. le Marquis de
Saint-Laurent and Baron de Vervainville was
drowned.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
